## Here I keep ideas & thoughts to improve the project

### TOP FUNNEL ANALYTICS: 
- It would be interesting when I scrape all the podcasts for 2025 to build a logic to classify all podcasts in categories and see how much views/comments they generated (popularity check). 
- SAME could be done for Guests. This will be more of a direct KPI analytics.

### COMMENT ANALYTICS: 
Views/Likes don't give the full picture, that's why digging into the comments is where we get the real stuff. What's worth looking into:
- Did people like/dislike the topic?
- Did people like/dislike the guest?
- Did people recommend topics/guests?

Also it would be interesting to see if there's a way to combine Top Funnel KPIs with Comments analytics. What I mean is, there are topics or guests that get more visibility, therefore there will be more data (likes/comments/views) in those videos which might increase the KPIs of certain topics/guests. I need to think of a logic to keep things fair. For example, a podcast that has 5M views but has mostly negative comments or didn't like the guest. Get the nuance and see how to best capture meaningful insights.
