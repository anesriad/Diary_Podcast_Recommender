As constructive feedback, just one small thing I realized, after watching three interviews with the same guest:
There is quite some repetition in stories that are being told by the guest. Its great to repeat, though, in a small time scale of watching, it appears wasting time and nearly makes you shut off the interview.

Maybe you could take more focus on repeating guests for not repeating same stories, examples, facts.

Here in japan its not norm, but in my realm of “friends” , some has plural girlfriends, most of them have girlfriends or families or two.  It is so funny that the most of scientific researches Paul mentioned in this video I have used myself, now I found many evidences proved  me right!! thank you.

Now, lowering your expectations is even worse: you essentially expect your partner to take care of you in good or bad times and stand by your side, when he suddenly vanishes if you're sick and/or cheats on your in the meantime. Well, guys, it's not a union, not a marriage, but a farce. 
It's not women who should lower their expectations, it's men who need to step up, because they now have no pressure from the father of the family or the society and are free to go as they please.

He probably would go through with the legality of it all if I truly wanted it…But I don’t. I want to live the life of a married couple. But what I don’t want is for us, specifically him to ever feel trapped into staying for fear of consequences outside of heartbreak. Meaning that if someday he wasn’t in love with me anymore, and didn’t want to put in the work to rekindle that love, I wouldn’t want him to stay for fear of losing his assets. As someone who loves him now, I want him to have the freedom to leave at any given time. And I just don’t think that the “incentives” in place rn make marriage by a legal contract worth it. It’s not a lack of commitment. If anything it shows more commitment to strive to make it work while also at the same time making it easier to leave.
If we were to ever “divorce” the biggest concern I’d want us to have is how we are gonna break the news to the other person. Not “Do I need to call my lawyer first?” Personally I think a lot of people, specifically men are being guilt tripped into feeling like they “have a fear of commitment”. When in reality it is more often a fear of what happens if you chose someone else who wasn’t ready to commit to you to the same capacity? And then after that fear comes the fear of the laws in place if they chose to leave.",@legendoflex6881,UCAnLfKC5pz-tQ5sO6k2YBxw,0,2025-08-21T13:00:49Z,False,False,

Get your head out of the clouds. Where are the good men in this world? The men who actually protect women instead of use them. It’s pointless. Most men end up being a creep. You want respect? Then protect. This has nothing to do with appreciation for other women’s beauty. This is about that women and children value and respect when men protect them. It’s something so fundamental and simple. Honestly the relationship is doomed or severely less than because at the core women in general can’t respect it. If women are honest - the vast majority just put up with it. Lack of respect is key here why relationships aren’t working for most people and no one is talking about this. Women and men would have higher satisfaction in the relationship if they respected and trusted each other. Men want to be respected by their partner - or do they? Maybe there are a lot men who just hate women or taking their childhood traumas out on women. Men are taught at a young age they should be with a lot of women. That is “normalized” and pushed on them at a young age. Where is that conversation? And then don’t get me started on all the addictions and the chaos and instability that brings with it.

The law should be as it is harder to divorce to allow the pair to cool down from hurt or anger and bring in both families and/or professional to mediate and mentor and try to reconcile the pair and allow them to realise many good things they share and have in common. 
Its also a  factt that the devil absolutely hates the union and institution of marriage between a man and a woman so much, that he fights this divine order from our Creator to be in wedlock, which provides stablity and longivity and a balance in our lives and the devil knows this too well and wants disunity and harm and disobedience from people towards what is a warm and cosy embrace between man and woman who then truely feel they belong as a true family. 
Think about a man saying he loves his wife but yet doesnt want to commit to the responsibilites within marriage to look after her and her to look after him but yet you both claim to love each other. Wow what a joke. And also prenuptial is another con and biggest joke for the same reason. A man should realise that his wife should be allocated in his will like one eigth say from his esate or what evet he leaves behind after death so that she can have that security and if they have children they are looked after properly with available finances.

I met my partner whilst on my OE in London from NZ. 
We were both enjoying life and experiencing fun and adventure . We ended travelling together and then returning back to NZ. Neither of us were interested in marriage and we were happy together. We didn’t ever see the value of a piece of paper in regards to our happiness and I was never a person who really cared about a big ring it wedding. We would rather have a holiday together.
We had our first child and only got married as our friends were hassling us!!
We have been together for 32years now and it is NIT because of a piece of paper or ring. It is because in those 32 years we have had the same core values about life. We have had heartache and struggles and We have worked through it all and supported each other. 
Love is the absolute core of our values.  Love of life and spending it together. Love is so much more than buying a box of chocolates. It is being able to count on that significant person in good times and hard times and grow your connection even stronger.

This means that details such as children, sharing of money earned in those years if the relationship dissolves, and so on are worked out and agreed up front,  complacency doesn't set in because there is no locking the other person in,  interest in the relationship satisfaction remains in both parties because they are aware the other person can easily leave if not happy, etc etc (allowing for clauses such as violence etc which can immediately break the contract - again, all spelled out up front).. Also allows for changes in the next contract as life changes etc.  As to the loneliness epidemic - I agree that men are struggling etc but I am sick and tired of people (usually men) not realising that women do and have suffered this for a long time. There seems to be a misunderstanding that because female culture makes it appear women have people they can reach out to etc because female culture demands women appear more social is really rampant.  I would not be surprised if most women are, in fact, and have been since forever, suffering loneliness - female social culture is brutal and superficial when you make the effort to merely rub the surface and the failure to make the effort to do so has allowed this disregard for the profound loneliness of women to go ignored.  As to looking for someone that earns equal or more than you - well.. if you want to have children then who is going to be responsible for bringing up the child (and all the additional tasks of running a household).. then yes you need to be earning more than me and you need to have shown your ability to succeed for future stability.. or you are saying that I 'get the privilege' of not earning my own money, the 24 hour a day, 7 day a week, 52 weeks of the year, upto and beyond 18 to 20 years burden (and it really is) of raising a child, all the while you expect me to be delighted I am going to live at a lower standard of living, and, as I will be out of the workforce so if something happens to the relationship I am unlikely to get anything other than a low paid, hard yards job?  well f you.

  Im from NYC that used my own algorithm/ time & system to meet with intention men as I was tooooo busy working. I narrowed down the virtues , character, self dis online, height as I am 5’10 and looking to GIVE love to receive it either honor . 
  I met , I dated some only wanted a hook up and sex.  By 30 I had a better system . No dinner, no takeaways on vacation weekend ,  no flyin me here or there no 100% any  1 professional sport , gambling, addictions.I want to laugh, chill be fun do stuff get to know the person engage in activities besides  just …..intimate but I gotta be attracted in personality and physical attraction. I work at it - I want the same. 
   Go to the party for 20 min, go to the meet up 20 min go to something with intention. Don’t waste your time . 
Look at yourself . Y would someone want you ?  What are your best traits virtues, character .Take a look in the mirror - not about money and things First. 
    Use it online social media apps as a the ole 20%  with 80% go organically-  go see, go,do , go travel , get out of your comfort zone touch, feel , eye ball to eye ball- 
Are you GU? 
Geographically undesirable?  The more you have to work at someone - time, money, space and interests - The more it’s important. The more spice. The more convenient the less one has to work for “ it” 
Too many choices , with no intention, narrow down what you enjoy and go to those  spaces & places .
 Organically , Go where your interests & values are.
   I’m successfully married, 33 years, I met my husband on a blind date. ( He was NOT the date. I went to please my girlfriend merely to meet for 20 min. 
 I married mid thirties , had 3 kids & a mid with our last child at 40. 
   Keep your health #1 for yourself. Mind body & soul. Be your best self not looking to change someone else. Change yourself , invest in your inside soul & be kind and selfless - Nothing is evvvvver 50/50 in life.

Marriage is often created for the very purpose to build a family. 
The biggest victims of an easy separation are the dependents, (children). 
They are effected both financially and psychologically and this should always be in the fore-front of every couples decision making. Our children were brought into the world by us and are therefore our chief responsibility. 
Careful, thoughtful separation is equally important. 
Marriage partners must consider financial responsibilities, as well as support their children and each other with guidance counseling for healthier emotional outcomes. This is not easy or quick.",@alisondegeus9451,UC0wwftGb3jsi0Awui3EV3dw,0,2025-07-14T20:09:12Z,False,False,

Single women tend to have a friend circle including -gasp- man friends. 

In fact, in bad marriages where the man is the problem, he tends to isolate her, he chases her friends away, he forbids her to foster contacts, he is deliberately making her more alone within the marriage with him than without. In severe cases, the man locks the woman up. With no visitors. When she tries to escape, there is a great risk he ends her. Even if her escape is temporarily succesful, he likely will stalk her, then finds an opportunity and still ends her.

Men leaving their wives when due to medical conditions she cannot perform her function anymore for him, is something typical for the Big Country and often invoked by  their very typical brand of religious culture, is it Evangelicals, Baptists, Puritans, where the wife is just an object for use. Not a person. He never loved her, he just loved the services she provides. 

An replaceable expendable part.

Single men apparently is different, in particular in the Big Country they are alone. Mostly due to self sabbotage that they refuse to do something about, no matter how much loved ones beg them (before they go no contact on him to protect their sanity against his negativity), no matter how many good quality resources are available for free to help them, these men reject every helping hand, by that men are sealing their own fate as they barrel down on their self chosen road of self destruction.

But often when you have marriage and you have intimate relationships it’s pretty sure that you’ll have children. That makes a whole different commitment to marriage. Children need both their father and their mother. And they need their mother and father willing to sacrifice and compromise so that the whole family has harmony. It shouldn’t be just about one anymore. It’s about being Selfless and caring to the point where sometimes you give up what’s important to you, and I don’t mean important as in immoral, I mean important as in wanting to go to the movies or see a different movie, or go to a different restaurant or whatever. But in order to get married, I believe you do need a commitment. And I really do like your guests suggestion that it should be a lot harder to get married without a lot of training and teaching and discussion.

In fact, studies show that culturally-driven arranged marriages cause plethora of problems when you care enough to look outside of ""relationship"" and into caveats. You essentially put two unprepared people who have little in common in relationships where both sides are foreign to each other. More likely than not, are emotionally, temperamentally and sexually incompatible. And when things go sideways there's clear power imbalance with increased vulnerability of women to abuse or mistreatment. Above all, base of these claims are divorce rates that are lower than for ""love marriages"" . The caveat in here is that in these cultures divorce is less acceptable/accessible resulting in low divorce rates.

Lower expectations on oneself, be grateful for good partner experiences, and learn early on to heed red flags from negative experiences.

We got together in 2005, and I’ve been her full-time carer ever since. We married four years ago.

I studied Fine Art at Leeds College of Art & Design from 1997 to 2000. But truthfully? College didn’t teach me shit. 99% of what I know, I taught myself. From my teens onward I was learning on my own time - pulling things apart, experimenting, getting better because I wanted to, not because someone told me to. The grades were great, sure - but that wasn’t because of what they gave me. It was what I already had in me before I even walked through the door.

I couldn’t build a normal career - I couldn’t go out to work because my wife’s needs came first. Freelance never lined up with reality. Eventually we ended up stuck - financially, emotionally, mentally. Just trying to get through the days. Fifteen years disappeared like that. Survival mode. Looping.

Then in 2021 I discovered NFTs - and for the first time, I saw a way I could build something on my terms. From home. Around her care.
I have an intelligent, pattern-recognising mind. I’ve spent my life studying all kinds of subjects in my own time - art, culture, psychology, systems, design, consciousness, strategy. I absorb everything. And when NFTs showed up, I didn’t just skim the surface - I pulled the whole thing apart.

So I didn’t just learn crypto - I studied the entire space. I figured out what works. What lasts. What doesn’t. What every single project was missing, no matter how hyped. And why most fail.

So I started building. And I’ve spent the last 14 months creating the biggest thing I’ve ever made: Hopium Town.
It’s disgusting and weird. It’s beautiful and manic. It’s hand-drawn - somewhere over 3,000+ parts, no AI, no generators. It’s held together with an invisible design structure most people will never notice. And under the chaos? It’s real. It’s made with love. It’s built from pain. It’s layered with hope.

It’ll be ready around the end of June 🚀

And because it’s a story-driven series of projects, Hopium Town is only the beginning.
There are at least 3 more major projects coming - each one smaller, rarer, more intense - and 3 or more side projects and more.
The whole thing forms a long story arc - a strange, playful, emotionally charged narrative that spans years, formats, and ideas. It’s built to evolve, and every part of it connects.

But this isn’t just a project.
With the funds from this project, I'll be helping my wife fight M.S. and I’m building a business - working toward something much bigger. It’s built on the concept of Hopium, with a structure designed to create value, help people, and change the world.

I have a mission: To unfuck the world, and make it unfuckable.

And underneath it all - I’m a Psychedelic Innovator.
Ever since I first dropped acid in 1998, ideas have never stopped pouring into me. Not shallow thoughts - systems. Visions. Massive, layered concepts I call ""Blueprints from the Ether"". I don't know where they come from, but I’ve been receiving them for 27 years. And now, finally, I’m building the kind of business that can bring those ideas into the real world. I'll be hiring the minds needed to construct the wildest, most beautiful versions of the future I’ve carried for decades. AI Agents alone wont manage what I have planned.

This isn’t a quick flip or a fantasy moonshot.
It’s the first major thing I’ve truly finished in my life - and the start of something with no ceiling.
I’m not here to sell hype.
I’ve waited half my life to build this.

And brother, we're both from Devon lol, born In Torbay and now live in Devon again 😃💚🤝

Most avoidants were enmeshed with and used emotionally by one or both caregivers. For instance, a single parent makes their child a surrogate spouse. They share too much adult information with the child and rely on their child to meet their emotional needs. This happens often in a divorce. In other cases, a parent might be sick or have addiction issues, which places the child in the emotional caregiving role. The helicopter mother or father. The possibilities are endless. The common denominator is that a parent places their emotional stability and emotional needs in the hands of the child. 

Think of it this way. The umbilical cord is meant to feed and nourish the child. WIth avoidants, the umbilical cord is flipped and the parent sucks the emotional life out of the child to feed themselves. Therefore, as an adult, when their partner makes a request or attempt for intimacy and connection, they will run. They relive the unhealed pain, frustration, and anxiety they experienced for having to take care of their parent/s. 

Their most effective strategy to avoid repeating the engulfment they experienced as a child is to continuously pursue what is called outside intensity. This means they always have something going on that is more important than the relationship. It can be their career, hobbies, the gym, pets, their children, becoming sick, addictions, affairs... It is a brilliant strategy because, in most cases, they can easily defend how they are deceptively avoiding connection and intimacy. It is hard to argue with a hard worker or a parent who spends time with the kids, is sick, loves their pet, or has a hobby, and it allows them to blame their partner for being too needy.

The blaming of their partner is how they discharge the unhealed pain, shame, and anger that they feel for being enmeshed with, engulfed, and ultimately abandoned by their parent. Fascinatingly, while it would seem like they were treated specially because the parent paid so much attention to them and gave them so much emotional power over them, ultimately, since they are using the child emotionally, they have also completely abandoned the child. 

That is why when their partner stops pursuing attachment, intimacy, and connection with them and withdraws, the avoidant comes running back.

So, the avoidant's conscious fear is intimacy and connection. They ""think"" they want to pursue other things much more than the relationship, and that those pursuits fulfill them. They are out of touch with the reality of what is really driving their outside intensity desires. 

Their subconscious fear is abandonment. They are entirely unaware that they were used and abandoned emotionally as a child, and that those outside pursuits are an attempt to medicate away their pain. They are unaware they are using their careers, hobbies, the gym, the kids, pets, illness, and all of their outside intensity pursuits to avoid the deep, unhealed pain from their childhood. 

In reality, deep down, they hunger for intimacy and connection, and they won't get into that truth and reality until they address the unhealed enmeshment pain from their childhood. Once they do, their desire for their outside intensity pursuits will become mature and moderate instead of all-consuming.",@kennyweiss,UC5eK9c7LRJoK6NW52nlythw,1,2025-04-17T13:43:43Z,False,False,

They'll leave their children, the women who have poured into them and supported them,  only to make another family with a woman they find sexier....only later to need the same people they abandoned, crying a river that they've made a mistake. 
I've seen men leave their long-term partners when they are sick with a terminal disease. B. Smith's husband had an affair with her nurse when she fell terminally ill with Alzheimer's. He posted the pictures with the nurse on social media with B. Smith. It was disrespectful and distasteful. He dared to be angry when the nurse took $$$ and left him. 
My girlfriend's father exposed his gf 3 weeks after her mother died from cancer. My bf cheated on me when I had Covid. My stepfather, who can barely walk because of a stroke, takes my mother for granted. He speaks about other women all the time and my mother takes care of him. He wouldn't be alive without her. 
Men are selfish and hypocrites. When I've given them what they have given me, I'm toxic and the worst person ever!...which I take as a compliment at this point in the relationship because it's over. 
Ladies, do not lower your expectations. This is Kevin Samnuels' rhetoric. You are setting yourself up to be abused and used. Men are not lowering theirs. They want the best woman to do what's needed for them and their needs. Men should work on themselves to be better people. Raise their bar and show up for their families. And men....if you have secrets, you are not ready to be in a relationship. A relationship is transparent. ""You can't be nasty and needy. You do not get to mistreat people and expect there to be no consequences. Decency is the price you pay for access. If you're burning bridges, don't be surprised when no one shows up with the boat..""

That is why you must begin to seek permission from them to divide assets, to divorce, and concerning your children. It’s a brilliant scheme they have normalized. Why would one need a license or certificate for something that was already lawful in the eyes of God? You can legally get married without the state/government—get married, write the marriage in the Bible and write an affidavit of the marriage, have two witnesses sign it, and either have a judge sign off on it or record it with the county recorders office. Then you’re legally married without the government. Please wake up people and stop letting the government make us all slaves.",@LOVE.7771,UCpXsqWNsWk40BF1plBkL18w,0,2025-04-06T21:53:14Z,False,False,

After surgery i had a pulmonary embolism. He wasnt at the hosputal when i came out if syrgery , he wasnt there when ibhad the PE.  I surviced both.  He came, was told if i had another there wouldnt be anything they could do.  I asked him if he could handle me coing back instead of another week of convalesence cause i was missing my children.  Once back the pressure to deal with makibg foid, school calls was imnense.  He blocked a free convalescence retreat through the benefits of his fire service.  He also rearranged the house, my loved dining room and filled my outdoor shed office with junk.  That was 2008, divorced 2016, he tried to take the children through the courts claiming many lies, not for him but to have them fostered out in spite to prevent me being entitled to home with them .  .  What was a shocking realisation a few weeks ago was that his anger was not that i wasnt well enough to do stuff but that i had not died.  He changed the hoyse thinking it was now his to do as he wished.  I had decuded i woyld rather live in a tent safely with the children out if this than with that.  I didnt decide to leave, just stopped fixing and rescuing. He did all the rest.  Its really dufficult to speak of this because no one could cope with being told this story.  And , im still realising stuff like him preferring id died.  2017 i got away wirh the children and have struggled financially and to heal ever since.  I take the view that constantly exploring info that allows me see this stuff, also allows me to heal even if it is painful.  At 61 i dont luke the years and years of intense lonliness, but, no way any boundary will be breached ever.

The goal is to be happy, fullfilled. And when you speak with the grand-mothers, despite making the choices based on arranged marriages were not happy either. 

People need to understand that we are not in old days ever. Even back then, women just didn’t have choice. 

Women are raised to be PERFECT, Nice mediators, active listeners, mature enough, virgin but yet sexually experimented. The issue is with men, who are Not having what it takes to be a decent human. Just from the jump, they avec issues with being vulnerable, honest. They want to pros of a relationship (sex, service) but yet with no responsability. And as I am seated here still listening to Paul, only men would fliP on a woman because of her skin color, her natural hair, the way she talks. Most of them would have so many expectations and yet can’t know their own blood type. The studies show that the most happy humans are single and child free women and married men, it says a lot. 

Men have been raised to not worry about their character, as there is still a woman who will date and marry him. We only have to see how women love prisonners. It clearly means that women don’t have that much of expectations. 

It also shows on how men are Quick to leave their sick women. 

I personally would NEVER EVER feel lonely enough to lower my standards. I make it a point intentionnally everyday to be a decent human, no matter the age, the place. Women have done enough to give men grace and it has nothing to see with who introduced who to who. 

Knowing that people are fake, hypocrites, would hate you but act the opposite, the people around you might say you are good on this, that, just because it is convenient. Everytime someone introduced me to a friend, I ended up telling that same person, who really was the person she/he thought they knew. People are hypocrites worldwide, they lie for everything and it is not well perceived to be truthful. They would say “not every truth is good to be told”, while God says he hates liars, fake, manipulative people. 

Let’s raise people  no matter their age/gender to be serious with their lives, decent humans. It is really that simple.


However, I love the way he talks about the fact that people can be attracted to other people and still respect this relationship when they want to make women believe that men would never be faithful because it is “natural”. Paul actually debunked the lies. People are dismissive, unable to simple love, appreciate what they have more.",@Financialride,UC1xT6wQXg8n5Qy5EGvKmJkQ,1,2025-03-28T15:22:35Z,False,False,

Actually, I don't sweep talk about ""race"" under the rug, and have found people of other broad racial groups don't want to have good faith discussions about it, aren't fair, i.e. judging, say, Whites harshly without leveling the same standard towards Blacks, or just receive flat out prejudice, stereotyping, possibly bigotry plain and simple.  When a person has seen enough, heard enough, and had enough bad experiences outside of their cultural-ethnic group, then survival kicks in and generalizations are formed.  Can't say I blame anyone for that.  At the same time, if someone is going to write me off for being independently-minded, a critical thinker, and daring to not agree with every political opinion they espouse, for example, then fine.  If they judge me as a r@cist for not being in line with ""highly racist society"" then they aren't open-minded, challenging of themselves to engage with true diversity, and are probably intellectually boring for my tastes.  No matter what the skin tone or ethnicity.  One more thing:  If someone wants to marry within their culture/ethnicity and discriminates against all others, more power to them.  Culture means THAT MUCH to them.  ( It does have many practical benefits. ) If another is far more adventurous and open to connection across ethnicity, skin tone, languages, more power to them.

Studies claim arranged marriages are happier, but how much of that is cultural? In religious or traditional communities, where divorce isn’t an option, people work harder to make marriage succeed. They may say they’re happy because it’s their norm, not necessarily because they truly are.

Relationships last when people commit to making them work, arranged or not. If a partner isn’t abusive or harmful, doubts and frustrations shouldn’t justify leaving.

The other thing is that arranged marriages come with dowries - often the parent's life savings - - and the dowry makes divorce impossible because forfeiting the money that the parents paid for you to have a marriage is too much guilt to bear.  And there are marriage negotiations between the 2 families - and that negotiation also involves the financial transaction of the dowry.

26:54: Paul Brunson’s statement, “We have to lower our expectations of our partners,” is an important idea to reflect on. As a society, we are often taught to expect our partner to be our one and only—the sole person we rely on emotionally, socially, and intellectually. In my country, there’s even a saying: one shouldn’t put the spoon between husband and wife, meaning people shouldn’t interfere in a marriage. While this saying dates back to ancient times, there was a strong sense of community up until 40–50 years ago.

For example, if my mother needed something, she would call my grandmother, her sisters or sisters-in-law, or her uncle. There were certain issues she never discussed with my father simply because he wouldn’t understand them—just as there were things my father never discussed with her. This reflects a time when people didn’t expect their spouse to fulfill every need—support came from different sources. Even now, as an adult, there are topics I don’t discuss with my mother, others I don’t discuss with my father, and some conversations I can have with both of them separately, one-on-one. And I am sure they don't rely on me or everything they need.

I feel that nowadays we make less effort to maintain a connection with a broader community. We don’t engage in daily conversations with like-minded people as much as before - we don't even speak to our neighbours anymore - and as a result, we subconsciously place all our expectations onto our partners, because they are the only intimate relation we maintain on a daily basis. When Paul Brunson talks about lowering our expectations, he isn’t suggesting that we settle for less. Rather, he means we should stop expecting one person to provide everything for us. Instead, we should seek fulfillment from multiple people in our lives. When we stop looking for ""the perfect partner"" and start looking for someone who has similar milestones and has some level of compatibility with oneself then we can build a fulfilling relationship. 

Ultimately, if we choose to, we can learn to tolerate and respect others. This is why some arranged marriages succeed—not necessarily because of deep compatibility, but because both partners consciously (or subconsciously) agree to make it work and respect one another for the sake of a lifelong partnership.",@analuciacarvalho1560,UCXnIlyIpeHwyf6FpJfW5YMQ,0,2025-03-04T22:12:06Z,False,False,

Being equally yoked has been interpreted over the centuries as being joined together with someone who has the same values but that's really just because when both spouses love Jesus and recognize him as their lord and savior, then they will also have very similar values because the Bible naturally informs those values for both people. In this respect, it is accurate to say that you should have similar values simply because Jesus tells Christians to marry other Christians. A Christian believes in a very particular set of ideas that start with the belief that Jesus Christ is actually the son of God and that he actually rose from the dead 3 days after he was crucified and that for all those who believe in him, they will be forgiven for all of their sins (because all humans sin and fall short of the glory of God and this reality separates us from him) and be able to be in relationship with him for all of eternity (this is heaven). Those who believe that this is true, naturally believe that the rest of the Bible is also a reliable source for truth and wisdom. It would be very hard for a Christian to be married to someone who did not also hold such radical beliefs.",@georgiadass2703,UC1eifHRO6KUm5KqG331Jpuw,2,2025-02-28T20:25:07Z,False,False,

While it has some good information, it misses the mark entirely!  It is reflective of the self centered world we live in.  I was hopeful when he mentioned the bible verse about being equally yoked, but his interpertation of it is entirely false.  It was talking only directly to christians and means that Christians should only marry other true Christians because otherwise they will not be able to go in the same and correct direction in life.  Marriage is not just about well being and self satisfaction, it primarily is about others including children brought into a marriage.  Marriage is a lot about sacrifice even if our partner gets sick, doesn't satisfy all of our needs, etc.  ...That is why there are marriage vows because life and relationships are not easy.  Basic values should not change if they are good to start...the value of commitment, faithfulness, love, personal sacrifice, love of God, family, neighbor, and country.  This is just setting people up to be more of narcissists than they already are!  Please just read the bible, you will get much better and deeper and more beautiful advice than this nonsense!

Nurses told me to find a hotel and take care of me but I just couldn’t leave my daughter there alone. My ex came after 3 days on the day his business was closed. The reason why he didn’t come earlier was because he had to work (mind you he owned a cake shop, his work wasn’t saving lives or changing the world and we were not in financial stress). Another excuse was that he was in pain so there was nothing he could have done in the hospital other than wait so he preferred to be productive somewhere else. I always knew that his business and his work was his priority but I never fully comprehended the meaning of it until I was a mother and I was confronted with this.

It’s not difficult. You go in search easily and naturally of all the reasons you shouldn’t and you politically correctly state why you should. I don’t think she is the issue either. You are married to the concept of running a business and you encourage it of her because it’s what attracts you emotionally. You are not yet at a stage of your life where you’ve found a deeper meaning of life which actually separates you from business and allow you to seek what marriage brings. You’ll get married but by the time you get there she would have changed. You are likely to get married to someone else. You are looking for guest and everyone to give you an answer on the next step in your relationship but deep down, you know. Your guest gave valuable advice and you should take that with you WHEN you are ready for marriage. Good luck Stephen. Just know your situation is not unique. It also happens to women. Your questions help many in your situation. For some they’ll make the step forward, others won’t.

If women stopped trying to do everything, she/they will certainly have more time to enjoy her/their family and life more.

Husbands should not be made to feel and be redundant and replaced by an ‘I CAN DO EVERYTHING’ woman/wife.

A husband needs to feel capable, needed, essential and effective.
Not be made to feel like he has to compete with his wife over who does more, who earns more, who does everything, who does everything better, who’s the winning spouse, etc.

I’m watching the one on attraction now. It’s valentines day, so I considered sharing to my social media. It’s a fantastic discussion on healthy relationships, but the headline is ‘If you get sick he’ll leave’. I feel like that would put a lot of people who don’t know your work off watching. Same for the ‘Marijuana is destroying your brain’. The headline comes across as anti-drugs, but it’s actually really interesting neuroscience that could benefit everyone. 

Just my opinion. I would love to see ‘What makes a healthy relationship?’ or ‘How to optimise brain health’ instead. Much more shareable.",@colinparker6275,UCnPukg7MmjZ1dY___XmfOiA,0,2025-02-14T09:34:12Z,False,False,

I grew up in Poland in a family with conservative beliefs but also with a modern mindset (my father always listens to the other perspectives and different point of view). What I want to say is that when you speak about marriage it sounds to me that it’s more like a contract to you, you can always have an option to leave and have a „happy” life somewhere else. But for me and other people that I know, it was always something more, something sacred about a marriage. It was of course because of God, He was very present is our culture and His commands were more important than some impulse like „happiness” somewhere else despite the fact that you have children, friends and family together. All in all, most marriages lasts 60years together or even more now in my hometown and nothing was as complicated as it is nowadays with modern culture. I felt very secure when I thought about marriage my whole life. I knew that it will be a beautiful adventure full of love and support through inevitable hardship of life. Commitment was something what hold them together and this is something what is in my heart as well. I can’t think about marriage differently because of example of  pretty much my whole family - divorce was an exception not a rule - showed me that it’s a great foundation to built your life around not something what you can/you should end when ever you feel that way. It’s sad that you think about it that way and have to even consider „what if”. But I understand that it’s because of culture that you live in.

There’s a saying about whether to do the hard things first or the easy things first, and the logical approach is to tackle the hard things first.

But when it comes to marriage, we do the exact opposite. Getting married is extremely easy—there are no requirements, no training, no preparation—while getting out of a marriage is incredibly difficult. By the time people realize they need to leave, they are already drained, and the process of divorce—court battles, family interference, and emotional exhaustion—becomes overwhelming. That’s why more people today are choosing to stay single or live together without marriage.

If we applied the “hard things first” approach, marriage would require real preparation. There should be courses and certifications in anger management, communication, and relationship skills before people are allowed to marry. This would have two major benefits. First, it would reduce problems because couples would be better prepared for challenges. Second, if issues did arise, people would be more willing to reflect, be patient, and try to fix things rather than give up easily—because they had already put in significant effort.

And if, despite all that, divorce was still necessary, it should be an easy process. Right now, we’re doing things backwards: marriage is too easy to enter, and leaving is too difficult.

Also, making marriage slightly harder to obtain would actually make it more attractive. People tend to value what is difficult to get, and if marriage required effort and preparation, it would become something people truly work for rather than something they rush into. Of course, we shouldn’t push it to the point where people become obsessed with the idea of marriage just because it’s hard to get. But adding some level of challenge would make people more serious about it, leading to stronger, more thoughtful commitments.

Too many respond with defensiveness or even hostility, leaving women thinking, why bother with a second date?

And even if a man is in perfect health, there’s another layer of concern. Thanks to the rise of self-proclaimed ""alpha male"" podcast gurus, some men genuinely believe that washing their asses with soap is somehow unmanly—claiming it's something only gay men do. When women hear this nonsense, it immediately raises red flags. Is he a narcissist? A misogynist? Suddenly, the idea of a second date becomes a hard no.

Me and my partner had been together before for about 3 months but broke up due to my partner wanted to go travelling after uni. After a year or so we crossed paths again and started dating and when i found out he still hadnt been travelling i told him we should break up when he goes but when/if he returns get back together if im still single. To cut a long story short, he convinced me not to break up but instead to quite my job and go travelling with him.

The moment he landed in Australia he was straight on tinder and i spent the next 3 months working, putting myself on a strict diet and hitting the gym like noone elses business i wanted to look snatched when i next sore him. Mean while he was doing everything he said he wouldnt do and although i had this annoying voice in the back of my head saying hes cheating, i told myself. No. Not him. Hes the best man ive ever known, he wouldnt do that to me, he would communicate with me like we spoke about before he left.

Part of me wishes i went on gut instinct and didnt get on that plane because as hard as it would have been to say good bye to the love of my life, i could have found someone that was ready for the relationship i wanted and maybe then i wouldnt have had to endure the pain of being cheated on...

When i found out he cheated it was 3 years into our relationship, i had waited for him to live out his dream of going traveling, i had quite my job, travelled the other side of the globe to see him, spent Christmases together, summers, built memories, then moved in together. Then locked down happened.  Finding out literally felt like having my heart ripped out my chest and stepped on, i felt violated, betrayed,disregarded, disrespected, taken for granted, treated like an idiot. It hurt so much i felt like i saw the man i loved die in front of me and morph into a monster. My partner describes seeing the love drain out my eyes. I nearly dropped out of uni i was in such a bad way. It effected me mentally and physically also there was a housing crisis at the time so there was literally no where to turn. My partner then spent the next year nursing me back to health whilst i searched for alternative accommodation, i forgave him because i could see that he felt truly remorseful, he saw what his actions had done to me and understood the gravity. I can see how the experience made him a better man. I slowly fell in love with him again but being cheated on by the one you love the most in the world is hands down one of the worst pains this existance has to offer so just concider that before cheating on someone you love. It will forever tarish the relationship. This happened at the beginning of my relationship, We have been together for 7 years in total and circumstances are what held us together.

It has been scientifically proven humans of all races prioritize looks above all else and there are distinct physical differences between races - that's the only non-malicious reason for racial categorization to even exist. If certain races have facial features that are on average less attractive to the majority of potential partners, that will display in the dating world. Racism implies hatred/fear generated from outside sources, whereas attraction comes from a place we can't influence or change as far as I know. In the same way a gay person can't find opposite sex atractive, how is it any different for racial preferences?

It's uncomfortable and challenges the ideal that humans are all equal in all ways, but there are many intrinsic inequalities as parts of our daily lives. Rich have unequally better and longer lives compared to poor people. People with high IQ lead unequally more fulfilling and happier lives than less intelligent people. Is it that much of a stretch to assume race having the same unfair, inherit inequalities tied to it?

If it can't be changed, if it is a natural tendency and not a human invention, history has proven many times it is best for everyone to form a belief system that incorporates the truth, no matter how difficult it may be, while minimizing the inevitable negative outcomes such as feelings of superiority based on these intrinsic advantages. You wouldn't consider yourself superior to a person of same age in a wheelchair, nor necessarily treat them with pitty, despite being undisputably physically more able.

Men on average still make more than women (and are 60% of the tax base), are taller, stronger, still work the most difficult dangerous jobs that build the backbone of society, are the most chefs and janitors, so there’s plenty that have skills around the house, ON TOP OF yard work, car work, broken things around the house, so I must ask, how can women not find enough of these men, because none of the statistics support their worldview.

There are a few points I want to make: 

1) keeping secrets is different from understanding when it’s better to share a certain information with your partner and temporary holding on talking about it. I don’t agree on keeping secrets which by definition means you know you’re hiding something relevant that you should say and you don’t, and having some basic communication understanding and knowing you shouldn’t probably start to talk about the toothpaste issue that annoys you at your partner’s dad funeral!
The example that Paul made about not telling that the ex wrote him because he knew that his partner was having some jealousy issues is exactly the opposite of what may help the relationship to grow. You have the opportunity to demonstrate that your partner can trust you by sharing that information that you know she would like to be informed about. You can show her the message and demonstrate that nothing bad happened by answering to that message. What happens instead if your partner finds out the message one day? Her jealousy will increase because she’ll start to wonder why you hide that message. 

2) apologising is different from feeling sorry. I think it’s important to always say that you feel sorry for how your partner felt for a certain behaviour that you may have had. This doesn’t mean that you wouldn’t do it again, it means you acknowledge their feelings and you are sorry for them to feel hurt or sad or whatever. Saying this to your partner can then open the conversation about why they felt in that way and you can work on it together. Even agree that in future you would behave in the same way but because this was discussed, your partner may not feel bad in front of the same situation basically.

3) NEVER going to sleep angry. This has been my rule number 1 since the beginning of my relationship. It’s true that you have the opportunity to process better after sleep however the morning after you may think it wasn’t important enough and let it go (really bad! Because this will make things accumulate!). You may also start to overthink when arguments are not soon resolved. It may be my personal experience - even though I think this happens to at least many women too - as a defence mechanism when I feel hurt I start to make the person that made me feel hurt my enemy. It’s a toxic way of thinking about the other person that pushes me to get apart, run away and say “fuck off, I don’t care about this person”. The longest I wait to solve the conflict, the worst this becomes. So my solution is to talk as soon as possible and what is really helpful is a kind reminder from my partner that he loves me and we’re on the same boat. That helps stop my toxic thoughts. Try this guys! 😂


Having said this, I love the discussion on these topics! It always makes me think on how I can improve my happy relationship!

So women may be picky, but we care enough once we do pick that only 2.9% will leave a dying partner. Maybe if men were more picky, they'd be more invested in their chosen partner and 21% would not leave when she's dying?

2. Satisfaction is way more crucial for a relationship than longevity.

3. The one, is the one who fits in the family structure.

Why not acknowledge the fact that women never had a choice UNTIL NOW on the matter of marriage and motherhood. And thats only referring to developed economies. It's no longer a necessity for female survival, and so standards and expectations increase naturally. The bar for men was set so slow before because society understood women didn't have options. 

Young men today are still raised in a way that makes them think the bar hasn't moved, but it has, and we need to start teaching our sons what it means to be a male PARTNER. It's not a six pack, or flashy sports cars, it's not a high paying job, it's not status. It's everything your mother provided for the family as you grew up, now YOU also have to do it along side your PARTNER.

All people of all colors have equal value as human beings, but skin color preference should be viewed as just another preference. Also, cultural preferences are also a thing, and most of the time culture is also highly connected with race (even within the same race there are tons of different cultures and sometimes are not very compatible for eachothers preferences).
Note that asian women are the most popular for all races of men while asian men are the least popular for all races of women. If it was ""racism"", then everybody would prefer their own race, but it's not like that.

That being said, I agree that we should give a lot less importance to our physical preferences and search for a bigger connection to have a strong bond, no matter the race, height, nail length, etc. Obviously there are limits to ""ignore"" in the physical department, but a strong happy couple is one of the best things for themselves and the community in general.",@GENCE.01,UC6QPbzADl4Wvr4q4BCz7E_g,0,2025-02-03T22:00:37Z,False,False,

That's fine. You can set your standards as high as you like. Just know that if you don't match those same standards in that perfect guy you date, he  will not commit to you. He will date and hook up with you but never settle down with you when your value doesn't match his. 

It's a dating market, ladies.  Your price needs to match your actual value or it will backfire on you! The same advice applies to delusional men who think they can get a model girlfriend by being a slob yet from what I've seen, most men know where they sit in their league and don't pretend they'll get some perfect 10.

It's really you women who are batting way out of your league and complaining when those top men refuse to commit to you. Either raise the standards on yourself so you can get the guy you want to actually commit or stop being delusional and lower your standards to something more realistic. 

All I see is average women demanding above-average men and there's not enough of those men to go around. 3 choices: (1) work on yourself so you're the best woman that a top guy wants to settle down with, or (2) share him with other women or (3) find a guy that's your value match.

Zero compassion for the women. 

Vows of in sickness and in health are apparently lip service coming from men. 

At the same time the guest acknowledges that most women are not even remotely satisfied, emotionally or sexually, in relationships. 

So men must be satisfied, even if the women aren’t, or the men will leave. But women stay with sick husbands even if dissatisfied. The men in this convo seem to think this is just a fine state of affairs…because they benefit.

So the husband isn't allowed to grieve the same way. It changes the dynamics of the relationship. And ultimately things fall apart. So it's not just ""the man just leaves"" like everybody wants to paint it out to be.
The burden of performance that men have is add odds with the support and the grieving that they are also going through.
It's a very bad mix of having to still provide, being accused of not emotionally supporting if they take a ""try to fix things"" approach, then get into a competitive dynamic of ""you're not the one that's dying..."" if they show any signs of grieving. And that point contains it's own ""not being seen as strong and masculine"" that happens when both are perfectly healthy.
The relationship deteriorates. Not ""the man just leaves"".",@gregorylagrange,UCcOPV-lcEobP0BguuTOw1eg,3,2025-04-22T15:04:15Z,False,True,UgwT5aJOrIL03DMTUwN4AaABAg

I worry that telling people to be selective about their honesty will give license to major dishonesty with the false defense of sparing feelings, like the idea of keeping infidelity secret because it will only hurt the other person.

He also got crazy amount of attention from ladies. 
The same about black women. Most of them are not exactly ""petite"" which most men prefer and that is why they struggle with dating and attraction. I knew a couple of black women who looked like the black Barbie dolls I used to have as a child, well those women got attention from every possible angle and direction, me,  ordinary white girl, was literally invisible when I stood next to them.

However, this tagline not only fails to reflect the depth of this interview but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Black men. Connecting such a negative framing to Paul Brunson—a highly educated, respected, and thoughtful individual—reinforces damaging narratives that portray Black men as overly combative, confrontational, or lacking depth, which is the complete opposite of who Paul is and what he represents. As a branding expert, I understand the use of provocative marketing tactics, but this approach dishonors his brand and risks perpetuating biases that have long plagued media portrayals of Black men . Personally, I hesitated to watch the interview because of the tagline, and I know others who avoided it for the same reason. This is unfortunate because the conversation is filled with valuable insights that deserve a wider audience. A more thoughtful and respectful approach would have better served both Paul’s reputation and the integrity of DOAC.

I wonder if you could get someone from either the film or music industry who is willing to blow the whistle on the type of entertainment we are getting today.

WE have no platform to bring these issues into the arena of public debate or discussion, but you do. 
This is a very important subject as these two industries are among the few megaphones of society, that have the power to shape our thinking, especially our moral values as we endeavour to learn and consider what is acceptable and what is not. In other words what is right and good, and what is wrong dangerous and unhealthy, and perhaps even evil.
Many of us who watch you, and I might add that's all my family, immediate and extended family, and all our friends, are worried about what kind of world our children are going to be living in.

Let's be honest, men leave terminally ill women once they stop being useful to them, and implying that terminally ill women had it coming for not being a better supportive partner is beyond the pale.

Of course no one should accept abuse or dysfunction or toxicity in a relationship. But the height and money thing…as a woman i can see how that can be an unproductive thing on which to focus. 

Now i do agree (and from the perspective of a woman of means), that there are insecure men who just can’t handle that. I’ve been there and yes, THEY are NOT the answer lol.

But as I’ve listened to this pod, I thought to myself I’m currently in arguably the best relationship of my adult life…and i have no idea what his salary is lol. (And we’re going on two years lol!)

What I focused on instead that IS completely relevant is what he does with his money…does he save, does he live within his means, can he take me out occasionally, does he invest? The answer to all of those is yes. So I’m glad the question of his salary never came up and certainly that i never made that a prerequisite for a relationship.",@Knwldgispwr,UC1thXPazYwGOjABaslcqmSw,0,2025-02-01T14:51:05Z,False,False,

Studies show that single women are not only happier than single men but also happier than married women. If single men did the basic work of finding their own happiness first, they’d be more appealing to women and would probably be better husbands.

Failing to do this gives the women you date emotional labor - yet another job you expect us to willingly apply to whilst expecting half our checks.

Muslims, hindus, buddhists, jews..  so it's pretty narrow-minded saying that it comes from the Bible. It comes from every religious text and every culture.

the last thing women should be doing is lower their standards. the standards need to be sky high to ensure that only men who also want love and an equal partnership are able to get into and maintain relationships.
women are the ones controlling sexual selection, not men. women need to select for traits they find desirable in long term partners, e.g. commitment and respect.

They will always choose attractive men over unattractive men, and any valuable internal qualities are therefore meaningless.  

In my experience, women all shoot for the most attractive man, ignore (with ire, sometimes) anyone ""not worthy or ugly"", then just hope this hot guy has some good personal qualities.  Nevermind the laundry list of great qualities I have as a person, but I've never been good looking (before, I'm in my 40s now and experienced a glow up...and boy to women treat you differently when you're attractive).

So my personal experience is that almost all women are superficial, unappreciative of a good partner, and don't even want those qualities.  They want a great looking guy who can be moulded into a good partner.

So again, women's ""high value"" are just the best looking, and highest earning?  I wanted a woman who was empathetic, compassionate, funny, intelligent, and I found her.  She's super attractive for me too, even though she calls herself average.

It’s striking how when asked the upside of marriage there wasn’t one emotion based answer…just statistics and probabilities. 

There has to be a propensity for creative imagination and storytelling for “love” to exist. It’s no wonder he doesn’t see a point in marriage—-he isn’t romantic!

This isn’t wrong—but marriage without love is just a business proposition.

Marriage without the delusion of love won’t be worth the work—Better to stay single!! 

Also, women don’t ask for what they want in bed because from day one the patriarchal system trains them to put others first and subjugate their needs.

They often don’t even think they can ask for what they want. So this issue is not just that of personality or sex differences, it’s ingrained by the larger society.

Women have a responsibility to learn to identify their needs and ask for them but men need to stop being selfish and focused on their needs. It’s absolutely horrid that the statistics on orgasms are so uneven.",@odessachen,UCfet9aDnByWKfa3sHQ0DUsg,26,2025-02-01T06:03:48Z,False,False,

That being said, I do believe that marriage is for some people. I personally just think it’s important to be able to up and leave, if you find that the relationship is not growing at the same rate as you are. Some people accelerate at growth and some are more stagnant. It won’t work; and if you find someone that will grow with you, then you don’t need a piece of government paper to validate your commitment :)

I also believe that when you don’t sign that paper, it will give your partner a reason to continually work on the relationship, instead of becoming lazy and comfortable, within it. Just my opinion. I also believe that people should spend years on developing themselves (self growth), before they commit to another. You can’t possibly know what you want until you have discovered several layers about yourself. 

Idk 🤷🏻‍♀️ - I don’t think I’ll ever sign that paper, but I could be wrong. The “right” person might be out there for me but I certainly won’t “lower my expectations”, as I know the relationship will only last 2 to 3 months, tops, if I do that.

Yes, men do need to receive grace. Conversely so do women. 

It is a human need. Not a gender specific need. 

One gender has traditionally over thousands of years always given it and has often been used and abused as a result. 

And one gender has traditionally, over thousands of years always received it, and now feels entitled to it as a result.

If there was a better balance in the giving and receiving of grace almost all of the problems between the masculine and the feminine would simply disappear.

This balance can be best achieved through having conversations with the other gender where curiousity about their perspective rather than blame or shame for having their perspective drives the dialogue.

Some self centeredness is healthy, no one should be a maytr, but throughout my life i have noticed that a decent portion of men will be selfish to the extreme.  They will prioritize their addiction, be it video games, gambling, cheating, drugs, alcohol ect over their loved ones.  They will also fail to participate in family life and project constantly onto their wives.  If a man sits on his butt all day playing video games and his wife does everything his wife suddenly becomes 'lazy' when the man feels like starting an argument or the woman brings up the mans addiction.  If a man is gambling and the family goes broke because of it the woman is 'spending too much money shopping"".  When a man is cheating he is constantly paranoid about the woman being a cheater.  This is extremely exhausting to have to live with.  Men bring all their problems into their marriages and use their wives as punching bags.  The majority of women on the other hand save their best selves for their husbands and children.  Women are walking away because they can.

It's not about accepting an option with less than a top market score. It's about settling for someone your heart is not fully with, usually because you feel pressures to get with the program. When you are in love with an objective 4, you are not settling. Your relationship is still a 10 even if the partner is a 4.

I think a lot of people here are missing the nuance of the conversation and taking everything these men are saying at face value.

The biggest divide I’m seeing is the conversation about standards.

There’s a big difference between preference and standards. Standards are non negotiable, and everyone is entitled to have their standard. What you’re not entitled to is having unrealistic or unreasonable standards.

Preferences can be malleable. I could prefer a woman who is shorter than me, has a big butt, brunette hair, brown eyes and tan skin. But if I find a partner that meets my standards for what I need in a partner but doesn’t necessarily match all my preferences, then I’m willing to let those go in exchange for a wonderful partner and relationship.

What I think is meant by the Bible verse, is to control your anger quickly, take a beat, go to bed before you do something rash or foolish in your anger.  Get emotionally regulated.  It doesn’t mean you have to resolve the issue that you are angry about before you go to bed.  And for sure it doesn’t mean stay up all night arguing until you do solve or dissolve.  The biblical verse does not say don’t go to bed angry, it says do not let the sun go down on your anger.  The biblical verse is telling you that one day is the reasonable limit to get yourself into wise mind, get control of your emotions, and acknowledge your wrath so you can then move on to make good, wise, high executive functions decisions about how you want to proceed to address the issue that provokes the anger.  So, semantics here, I would say you don’t go to bed angry, you control your reactions to your anger, so that you are not so emotionally dysregulated that  you can actually make the good decision to go to bed and “sleep on it”, and hopefully you won’t just pop off again the next day, but rather your anger can be intelligently channeled into peaceful resolution.",@andreahunter2471,UCDNkqDzDSSLZtuDO02rugCA,0,2025-01-31T18:43:33Z,False,False,

You need to have one partner’s underarm be at the height of the others top of shoulder so one can put their arm around and the other snuggle under that arm comfortably.  Typically women go into the protective arm of the man, but if she is taller by 4”, and the dude doesn’t feel weak and submissive, functionally, she could be the one who puts her arm around him.  A super tall guy and short woman can’t snuggle tight fitting either.  8” allows 3-4” heels and still fit into his underarm for snuggle while walking, standing, dancing purposes. When your shoulders butt up at same height, neither can fit into crook of arm and it’s awkward to put one’s arm around the other. Since men don’t wear much more than two inches of shoe, a woman could be 4-6” taller and get her arm around him pretty comfortably.  But not all women want to be dominant like that.

The next step is to get a real doll and scripts for viagra bc you cannot get an erection naturally.

Porn addiction is an unhealthy global epidemic and the speaker here is speaking MYTH. 

Normalising any addictive behaviour is denial that whatever we do has a reach and effect on Others lives, period. So, if you are avoidant attached you will celebrate normalisation of porn because real peoples feelings are irrelevant.

On attachment read Stan Tatkin.

It is true that one only needs to abstain from porn a month to achieve that level of dopamine with our partner or real person.

Alongside porn addiction is the 90 hours per month spent finding the right flick and the 30,000 scholarly research and meta data on your partners “feelings”. 
Consensus is not normalisation. 

Moreover, whenever an Expert answers a question that their esteemed colleagues said, “not telling your partner is wrong”, doesn’t change the fact that whatever our behaviour or actions has a reach and effect on Others. For example, you don’t need to make any effort of connection with porn as you would with your partner. So, you really don’t have a happy relationship if you prefer digital over your partner, ever. Google scholar. 

On communication: 
Read Marshall Rosenbergs Non-violent communication alongside Gay Hendricks Conscious Loving. 

I would not bother to read this speakers book. His approach is typical re-packaging of Others ideas, and contributes to collective unconsciousness. 
All psychology, except for Jung, is unconscious and most psychologists eventually try the path of awakening to really heal of “attachments” and to be happy all the time.",@doyleclanperth,UC8MPilbAnFDTDEmFxm0lPiw,0,2025-01-31T16:55:53Z,False,False,

So we eloped as we're both introverts. Worked for us. I can see why planning a wedding is nightmare fuel but it prepares you for challenges like say...having 3 kids with great difficulties. Or maybe he gets sick? Or maybe you do? It's good practice.

We should all be with someone that at the bare minimum respects us and, crazy to even say this, LIKES us. The reality is most people are going to have to come to terms with finding companionship and community outside a sexual relationship since there are a lot of emotionally stunted scared adults.

A good start as to relationship dynamics; attachment theory, Gottman (Trust is a must read)
And, for “anxious attachment”, taking to court - is certainly doable not only for relationship anxiety but for ANY anxiety.

Personally, I followed the psychology rabbit hole as far as it goes and found that psychologists in later years learn Buddhist practices to understand all of this. 
Hypnosis, such as RTT, also helps getting to the root of our subconscious emotional conditioning without having to meditate for months to years. 

Low Self esteem can come from nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalance, microbiome. 

Bad people(? Read, the Boy Raised in a Cage like a Dog. I have found less than 2% Avoidant attachments are “curable”, yet they are the majority of the available ppl on dating sites. To my mind, the safest bet is the widow/widower because they will be “secure”.
Avoidants need to learn empathy and compassion. They wander the earth thinking interdependence is neediness. 
People usually can not give what they never received at a pre-verbal age. 

Conflict management is our attachment style. Witnessing our parents win/win style. Change the plan, not the goal. Never compromise. 

Good good! Learn healthy boundaries from healthy people. But, that is irrelevant in a relationship advice with an avoidant. Their attachment is only a dopamine fixation with an image or story about the future. They cannot live in the present. If they are triggered they ruminate about escape without consideration of the reach and effect on Others lives.",@doyleclanperth,UC8MPilbAnFDTDEmFxm0lPiw,0,2025-01-31T15:11:55Z,False,False,

First of all, getting into situationships over a relationship with a person who has indicated that they would commit to you isn't respect for yourself. That is letting infatuation take charge over reason.

Secondly, you will always miss something in your relationship, a person can only do so much. You need a variety of people in your life to fill in different needs or desires that you have. Regardless, you can probably list the traits that you would like to see in a soulmate. Now for you, the crucial question becomes ""What are these types of men looking for?"". By your own admission, men that you're attracted to didn't want to commit, meaning that you weren't what they were looking for. You either become what this type of man is looking for so you both can fully commit or you can keep moseying along doing the exact same thing over and over again while wondering why it doesn't work.",@Ancor3,UCvEQYyis-vvepurg0Nbys_Q,0,2025-02-03T08:39:39Z,False,True,UgxzqcXsLKCtuLkNDD14AaABAg

Women are perfectly happy to accept even major flaws in a guy - they just don't want to settle for a weak relationship. They want to be in love with the dude. 

If you are in love with an objective 4 and get to marry that 4, you did not settle. You got a 10 relationship.

Also, a wedding is saying it in front of many people and it is something beautiful. You share that important moment with the ones you love and have witnesses to part of your life. You are “seen” in that huge step. It also makes it more difficult to quit. Sometimes in marriage (and any relationship) you have difficult moments, and when they pass they were only that: moments.

(Rhetorical question, to which the resounding answer has got to be FUCK NO, as I'm sure you can see. Please think through the implications of this awful analogy before sharing any more widely!)  Stephen: is your partner's anxious attachment style running things? Running the relationship? Running you? Does she respect your work? Your boundaries? You? Herself? Do you truly *love*her*? Why can't you have a friendship with your ex who just congratulated you? Are you going to ghost her because you're not allowed to love her any more? And lastly, does it work when a man enters into such a massive commitment as marriage in order to please the woman?  (BTW Stephen, I listen to your interviews sometimes because I like you, and like your manner, like your honesty, your courage, and sense a good heart; I like the analysis of detail, and I like/need to hear how people in the mainstream make sense of things. But I don't subscribe because each time I'm frustrated by what I perceive as a lack of metaphysical underpinnings – a lack of spiritual and emotional depth, if you will, and not enough consciousness, e.g. some of the above unconscious emphasis on transactionalism – that leaves a hollow lack of meaning/values in both your own discourse and that of your interviewees.

It is because we're easily swayed by emotions that we return to values, especially when times are tough. Opinions might change, tastes might, hell emotions change daily but values are meant to be immutable and to show us the path when we inevitably stray.

The reason women leave at a lower rate after the partner gets sick (e.g. cancer) is because often times the things a man brings into a relationship are still there (finances, leadership, masculine energy etc.) Only the physical part is missing but chances are the physical intimacy was already gone at stage of their life anyway (thanks to her daily headaches). So she's still getting at least 51% of what she needs out of the relationship. Now let's flip it. When a woman is physically incapable due to the same sickness she's basically useless. No.1 thing a man needs from a woman is unlimited and guaranteed access to physical intimacy. Yes, that's why we get on one knee because we believe that's what marriage will give us. The man who has been taking care of her throughout the relationship (financially, with leadership and protection etc.) now gets nothing when she gets sick. Nothing of what's valuable to HIM. So on one hand the woman is still getting a enough (for her to stay) and on the other hand the man is getting nothing. Just a useless person that requires more but has an ROI of 0.0%. I'm surprised it's only 20%. This shows how benevolent and inherently good the overwhelming majority of us men in the world are. Also don't forget: women are social creatures. They will do anything to avoid being viewed as the 'bad guy' by society. So they begrudgingly sit it out with their sick husband hoping things come to an end quickly. It's not because they're so loyal. Remember: 80% of divorces are initiated by women and it's not because ALL those men were toxically abusive patriarchs...",@aresvonmars9708,UC46Gzn7Kvdux0LP58LYZSzw,0,2025-01-31T09:38:04Z,False,False,

He was balding and overweight, wore cowboy boots and a Stetson hat. Do you know what attracted me to him? In addition to being funny and kind, he was impeccably dressed. I’m not talking about expensive clothes, but his jeans were clean, his shirt ironed, his boots polished. His old Dodge truck was always clean when he picked me up, he smelled good and he was well groomed. He put a napkin on his knee when he ate. He was popular at his work. People liked him! He was not racist nor spoke poorly of his ex. When we were married, I would wake up on Sunday mornings with him making pancakes with fresh strawberries, and there would be a rose on my pillow. When I was going through a tough time with my daughter and be upset, he would say ‘don’t worry darlin, my shoulders are big enough to carry both of our problems’. He would grab me and dance me around the kitchen. Unfortunately, he was killed in a work accident after only 13 years of marriage. He knew what it meant to be a man. I never found another one. He wasn’t rich, he didn’t work out, he didn’t have a sports car. He made me feel safe and supported emotionally. I hope I made him happy too. He was the love of my life.

We’ve both changed so much since we first met but we have grown more and more in love - I have been truly blessed

I would be devastated to lose the sanctity of marriage- I think that if it is too easy to walk away from then it will become a disposable fad

""We love and support men but when we need them they run.....""

Divorce rates are at the highest they've ever been with the majority being initiated by women! The majority of which are because of ""financial reasons"".

 No accountability on your side at all. Not one bit. 

Swap the roles around. He loses his parent (which is truly sad I'm sorry for that) and then he got depressed, piled on the weight and just sat around for years unhappy and miserable. 

Would you stick around? No you wouldn't. 

No because men don't get to do that! Men need to pick themselves up and keep going! Because we all know damn well women will bounce if we don't carry the weight of it all on OUR shoulders.  

I'm not justifying what your husband did. I'm simply telling you that YOU played your part in it happening. Take some damn accountability for one moment and realise YOU played a part in what happened. 

You could have dealt with your depression. Could have eaten healthier, exercised more.....anything other than wallow in self pity.

But no...easier to be the victim because that's what you believe.

I don’t date poor black guys because that culture lowers my chances of sucess in the long-term. For context, I'm a poor american white woman.
When I date a black guy, the amount of disrespect and sexualazion has across the board been MUCH higher on first dates. I have to be so much more picky about black men because I know if his friends are black, they're more likely to cheer him on to act like that; to reward him socially for having a side chick. That his family will just shrug if he cheats or abuses me. I think black men are hot, but my EXPERIENCES taught me that dating black men is the most dangerous thing I can do.
If most their friends are not black, if they live in an area not predominantly black, I might risk it.

But can you meet his? It is fair to say that, but you can't do that and then not meet him. Like standards are either dimorphic (opposite quality traits, say masculine and feminine traits such as if you want him to pay all your bills, then you need to cook and clean 100% or a woman wanting a big strong man and him wanting a beautiful sexy woman) or equal (if a man wants a provider partner then he wants someone who makes the same money as him and can pay half the bills and pays for gits for him too and the woman and man split all households tasks 50/50 unless for pregnancy reasons or obvious emergency reasons).

Second, most women aren't looking for equal partners in terms of protection and providing. They almost universally want someone who makes more than them and is physically stronger than they are and wants to take the lead (may be wrong on that one, but based on social media trends only for that one). How is that equal? This doesn't even take into account issues of emotional abuse, sexual incompatibility, and the problems of frequent divorce. Like 80% of men arent leaving marriages. How would most women feel if men did that?

I understand wanting a good man who is masculine and of good character. But you can't ask that if you are not a good woman (in particular, someone who will be loyal, not emotionally abusive, consistently agrees to have sex in agreed-upon fair timeframes excluding emergence periods like pregnancy, and can be guaranteed not to leave for frivolous reasons) and someone who is feminine (cooking, cleaning, childcare, general attitude). At the end of the day, men may swipe right around 55% on most major dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge). Women swipe around 6% on the most prominent dating apps. Considering what I find most women talking about, I can only guess that it likely revolves around finances and physicality and looking nice (approachable and kind). At the end of the day, you can ask for a handsome, nice, millionaire, or billionaire guy. But if you do equal with him and/or he doesn't want that, then your only option is to be a traditional woman, and then it comes down to how good a traditional woman in terms of skill you are. Which is what the vast majority of men want even if they can't afford it. But if you still want that guy and he wants someone, though less likely, who pays the bills as well, then you will have to be 50/50, or to both having jobs but because most woman want a man who makes more means depending upon how much you pitch in financially means you will have to do the same amount of homemaking (cooking, cleaning) in inverse of how much you pay and that is only if you can actually afford to pay a fair amount of the bills. This applies to literally almost any man in any bracket with self-respect and self-worth generally speaking. At the end of the day, there are simply differing types of traditional and 50/50 relationships, but on some level it always fits into different type of those type of marriages. Suppose you can't provide the necessary qualities needed for that type of relationship and refuse to be feminine. What makes you think that you deserve that guy, especially when he has so many options there are so few of them, and you need him to be masculine? Not to mention, if you aren't willing to go 50/50 or traditional, most of all truly, what makes you think that is a fair, equal relationship for him? 

It is all good to actually talk about fairness. But only if you can actually offer the same rewards to your partner in return.",@alecsinger3364,UCk_71zHhgJrgmu9zBRLyydg,1,2025-01-30T22:24:36Z,False,False,

Happened to my neighbor- she was talk gorgeous and lived with her boyfriend my neighbor- he always seemed moody and chatted with me whenever we met - he gave me single vibes- so was really surprised he had a woman living with him for years. They were cohabiting and were like husband and wife. Anyhow, one day I heard her screaming, “ Where can I go ?!” a few times. I thought one of their fights but she seemed especially hysterical with this one. Next thing I hardly see him around the house- he comes in and out once in a while- then after I came back from being away for a while I see a woman with a Baboushka who had a more motherly figure going into the house. I wondered if that was the girlfriend but she sure looked different to the slender model a figure. We never spoke all those years because her boyfriend would say she was quiet. She came to collect a parcel from me and we got speaking. She had broken up with my neighbor. He was living in his other house and letting her stay in this house until she finished treatment for breast cancer- she was only in her mid 30s - she actually said she liked meeting people- it sure seemed different when he was around. She then disappeared and he put the house for sale. It wasn’t long before he found a much younger, fit sporty attractive type and she seemed wealthy as she came in this red new geep with him - the kind you go off in adventures. That fellow always gave me the creeps a little despite his soft spoken polite exterior I always felt he hid some quiet rage - the classic narcissist- use and discard. If the next one falls ill and bankrupt, no doubt he’ll be off for a new model. Women always find out dating history.

I literally started gaining weight bc I was stressed in the connection. No thank you.

He didn’t initiate any calls to talk about the seriousness of his message, I did, I lead the conversations and I brought up us meeting up after 15 yrs. His inability to communicate was unbearable and disappointing. I blocked him. He’s been trying to plant seeds for years and NEVER once said how he truly feels or took the initiative to further our connection. I’m not a therapist, an emotional crutch or a speech pathologist.

In which case, find someone who's like them and we need to find someone far more like us. That's okay. That's healthy! That's how we find a match.

I believe gf/bf status is a necessary step. But I believe if 2 people are in a relationship and one wants marriage and the other doesn't, at some point, there must be a compromise. 
What I've noticed and experienced is that a man or even a woman will say, ""I don't believe in marriage"" or ""I don't want to get married,"" or ""I don't want kids,"" but many of these same people will break their own boundaries with someone they're head over heels for or who they believe is worth it. 
If I am in love and believe I'm with the person I want to be with for the rest of my life, I will commit. If commitment looks like marriage for my partner, because a relationship is about compromise, I will consider that. If my reasons are, ""they could take my money in the future,"" ""they could leave me in the future,"" overall, just being afraid of the future ""what-ifs,""  ""unknowns"" or ""failures,"" than I'm choosing to focus on the negative, and allow that to deter me from the possibility of feeling fully satisfied in my relationship with the person I truly love. Because if your partner wants marriage and you don't,  then there's dissatisfaction in the relationship already. 
I understand that everyone has different views and values, and I might not be considering other ""possible"" reasons that could be valid from my pov, but that is yet to be determined, lol. 
Men/Women who do not commit to marriage most times it's because they are afraid of losing something and they're not willing to put it all on the line for love (most times because they aren't ready or they don't feel strongly enough for the person they are with). Of course, you can live and love a bf/gf til death do you part, and I get that some people are logical and scientific, and they lead less with emotion, but there's an emotional part to being human, that I strongly believe must be acknowledged and fed. The majority of women want to KNOW that their person, their true love, will risk it all for the sake of loving them. We're not asking men to do anything criminal or irrational. We just want you to say, ""I love you enough to go there with you because I DO (pun) love you and you're more important to me than the fears, the unknowns and the risks"". 

To simplify it. If you're bf/gf, there's no risk in saying you love someone. You break up, you go your separate way, there's no mountain to descend, there's nothing. To us, that means ""you're not worthy enough for me to risk it all for."" Period.",@Hercasl,UCqqVF1nmOHDh8fR9GWrr4Ig,5,2025-01-30T22:58:36Z,False,True,Ugw8p-ltFcFu2NTTjdh4AaABAg

While I don't think that men are saints when it comes to a lot of things (there are some areas where we measure up pretty badly and visa versa), there are some areas where women could use a mans perspective. When Paul says lower you standards, I don't think he's referring to the internal factors of a man (kindness, integrity, trustworthiness, charisma humor etc) which we ought to desire, I think he's referring to superficial standards which may not add as much to your life as you think. Please consider the following:

- Only 15% of men are over 6 feet tall (Most women have a preference for height in men)
- The average UK Income is around 25K per year (Most women have a preference for higher income in men)
- The average Uni Graduate makes around 40K (Many women have a preference for higher income, educated men)
- The average 🍆size is 5.4 inches (Most women have a preference medium-large 🍆 in men)
- Many if not most men have lower self esteem that you'd think but society conditions us to hide it 
- Most of us aren't particularly confident (Most women have a preference for high confidence in men - ironically attracting psychopaths/Machiavellian/narcissist/players etc)
- Most of us aren't particularly funny (Most women have a preference for great sense of humor in men)
- According to ok cupid statistics the average women only finds about 20% of men to be more attractive than average based on facial features alone compared to a mans 50%. You can read about this in the book Dataclysm

I could make this list a lot longer but I hope I've made my point. When woman complain about being objectified (which is a perfectly valid complaint, which we absolutely should be talking about) I fear that only half of the story is being told. Men don't care about your: height, income, genital dimensions, charisma, confidence, whether or not your funny, whether or not you have high self esteem etc. You could probably write everything a man wants on a post it note, we're remarkably simple creatures. Please carefully examine that list above and notice that all of the standards listed above EACH exclude the majority of men. Many woman want outliers within outliers within outliers literally. Most men are happy with the girl next door, but women want prince charming and when we don't live up to these unobtainable standards you think you're settling. 

This cult like mentality of not lowering your standards that some women seem to have adopted is going to be your undoing. It literally doesn't add up. If only the minority of men are superficially attractive, whereas there are many more attractive women (Which I and most men can attest attractive woman are a dime a dozen) then most women are not going to find the perfect man. That begs the question, once you've found the perfect man, what if he's not interested in you? What if after you get over his height, money and superficial charm what if you're not that into him?
Ask yourself ladies: 
Who really has higher superficial standards?
Who's standards are more likely to leave us lonely or in an unhappy relationship?
Have you ever sat down a wondered what life is like for the average man?
If you have never done this then maybe you should (men should absolutely do this to), open up a dialog, talk to the men in your life, you might be surprised.
Anyway I can't be bothered to write anymore but I had to say something because this might be the craziest, most cult like, self centered comments section I've ever seen",@bakedlakes9023,UCmI3HhKLl2Pns9f4SsNm1xw,2,2025-01-30T19:58:46Z,False,False,

I fear that you may have misunderstood what I said. If you wish to pass up men entirely, that's absolutely fine, provided that you have healthy reasons for doing so (of which there are many). What I said was, ''The...mentality of not lowering your standards...is going to be your undoing'' which is a completely different thing. If you have very high  superficial standards then you are literally playing a numbers game that is rigged against you. For example if you actually do the math here's what happens: 

1) You want a man who is 6ft or more (15% of men)
2) Who also earns more than average (that's 50% of the previous 15% which is 7.5%)
2) Who is facially attractive (that's 20% of  of the previous 15% of 50% which is 1.5%)

Only 1.5% of men fulfill these 3 simple criteria and that's before you get to non superficial standards such as: compatibility, kindness, communication skills, integrity, chemistry, do you even feel safe around this dude?, intelligence, morals health etc. not to mention other superficial standards. 

It might seem excessive to do calculations but please ask yourself, if someone has a set of completely superficial standards, WHICH EXCLUDES ATLEAST 98.5% OF MEN, before you even get to know the mans character, could you begin to understand why someone might suggest lowering you standards? 


Just to be crystal clear, I hope my message doesn't come across as hostile, it comes from a loving place. The reason I wrote this is because I don't want our countries to end up like South Korea or Japan a country where:
- Practically no one is dating
- Everyone pretends that it's ok and that they're empowered (especially women) but in reality a significant percentage of people are depressed and desperate
- Communication has largely broken down between the genders
- Suicide rates are at an all time high in these places 
- Women bully each other into saying, ''I DON'T NEED NO MAN!!!'' (though in reality we both very much need each other) and become purely career driven (which is very good to a degree) but completely neglect relationships and starting families 
- As a result of these factors (plus many more) the populations are aging in those countries. 
- Many people just become empty hedonistic consumerists who live to work and work to live then they die

I don't want our countries to end up like these dystopian nightmares, this is their ''undoing''. On a more individual level if you wish to remain single that's completely your business, if that's how you remain at ''peace'' then I wish you all the best with that, just hope you're being fair and completely honest with yourself, and not allowing yourself to be influenced by external forces that may not have your best interests at heart. Only you know whether or not this is the case.

It gives a message to the children who come from that marriage, that both parents cared enough about each other to choose each other and no one else and commit to it openly and legally: My parents are here for each other and will be here for me, too. The door is closed; it's not left open a crack to keep an eye on other prospects, greener pastures, or an easy exit. We can sleep with both eyes closed instead of with one eye open. I can't imagine desiring the commitment of marriage and my partner telling me no, that essentially there could be someone better out there and that he's only committed UNTIL she comes along or UNTIL I'm not good enough anymore.

MOST WOMEN, who are married for more than a few years, WISH SHE WERE SINGLE, (even if 'secretly') MOST woman (married or not) thing hetero males are misogynistic, narcissistic, repulsive and egotistical, MORE and MORE women are 'choosing the bear', going 4B, and choosing to be/remain single and abstaining.

FYI: I'm born in Jamaica and I don't like your message because it's smacks of 'out of touch with reality'.

His explanation: he did not like hospitals and he told her that she smelled of cancer. I could not believe it. She divorced right after surgery and organized a party 3 years later after treatment had finished. The divorce went very ugly. He tried to get as much money as possible and stopped working. So she had to pay him an alimony.,@leonorep.9162,UCW5luL7HzQzSXKtpKBJ7YRA,38,2025-01-30T18:13:13Z,False,False,

It's objectively money and social status, the overwhelming majority of women will not marry a man who earns less than them.  Women typically will also not marry a man who they consider socially ""below"" them either, ie a plumber might make more than a woman, but because he's not ""educated"" nor does he have a high social status, an ""educated"" women won't consider him her equal.    Women are naturally hypergamous, that's an evolutionary reality that's backed by numerous studies across nearly all cultures.  In a society where women and men are social and economic equals, there will always been a debt of ""marriageable men"" because women don't marry down, only men marry down... that's just basic math.  It has nothing to do with ""respect, emotional availability or, sharing of the domestic load"".  That's completely illogical nonsense.  Modern western men are more respectful, emotional available, and willing to share the domestic load than at any time in history, and yet this wasn't a problem before modern history and dating apps... even as recently as ~20-30 years ago.

The real reason is two fold, women's social and economic status has risen to the point where there are not mathematically more men above than than below them as was historically the case, and social media and dating apps have driven women's hypergamous nature into overdrive by giving them a daily dose of seemingly ""better"" options delivered write to the palm of your hand.  What it's essentially created is a large group of women sharing only a handful of the men who meet their increasingly high standards.

The point is that you shouldn't be looking for everything in one person. When you're looking for someone who can do 3 things instead of 10, you might actually find someone of superior ability in those 3 areas. Not only you're lowering your chances if you do look for everything in one person, that person is going to be bigger compromise (you will have to use a lower standard to find anyone at all).

Say, only my partner can be a mother to my children. So, being a good mother is a high priority. But anyone can go mountaineering with me. I can easily find someone for intellectual debates. I don't even have to do it in person, we can be pen pals. Realize what is the core and what is just a bonus. And be grateful when you find someone who fits your core needs well. PS: Let's go back to intellect. She needs to be smart enough that I don't look down at her. I can't date an airhead. But she doesn't have to be so smart that I admire her for her intellect. Because there is plethora of things I can admire her for. And the biggie is being a good mother, that really works for me (it just tickles the right button in my brain). Even though I would love to have philosophical debates with my partner, it's not necessary. Everyone likes a pretty face but the fact is that brain filters out constant stimuli - you get used to her face and you stop perceiving it. I even have a theory that imperfections serve in bonding (perhaps a better way of putting it would be features that stand out). Because imperfections make us individual.

Otherwise, if you do insist on ticking all the boxes, you might be unhappy with a partner that is actually a very good fit for you just because he doesn't fit some irrelevant, BS box that you think you need which could easily be ticked elsewhere. Being happy and content is in a way skill. Some people are just determined to be miserable. A big factor is the ability to set expectations. High expectations are always a recipe for dissatisfaction. That's just the way it is. That's why it's important to cut it down to the bone, to determine what really matters and throw the rest out.

If you want a committed relationship, that puts unique demands on it. And you should prioritize corresponding qualities. If I fall out with a friend, I can easily find someone else to go mountaineering with. There is no long-term commitment. And in a way, it makes it easier. Non-committed relationships are easier to navigate, easier to be happy with. You need particular skills for a committed relationship. And not all people are cut out for it.",@jobicek,UCpjsNX2xALx_tKDv-O-6wpA,5,2025-02-02T09:10:30Z,False,True,UgzGdMNDcuauM7k3AX94AaABAg

If we are talking about physical features, characters features, resources or psychological state of individual. Situation is not as easy as it seems.

Lets do some math and assume following:
- not married 
- any race
- at least 5' 11"" (180cm) tall ( only 23.6% males in us population)
- not obese (only  58% males in us population )
- earning at least $100,000 per year (only 18.8% males in us population)
- and age from 18 to 60 
So how many percent of male in US population meets these standards in that age bracket?
0.64% or 1 100 000 males that met those requirements (in global term it is much lower percentage)
I would even bet that most females will want more and then that on top of that all these are requirements on that he needs to masculine, intelligent funny, charismatic, good in bed, well endowed, and all these will inevitablity mean even lower percentage than that :)

On the other hand i dont blame females (evolutionary psychology is cause of that) for high standards in looks or any other department, because attraction is not a choice and most men are considered repulsing for females.

This is just an illustration and your situation might be different. This is no hate, just a food for thought.",@martindekan5625,UCY6wWpyfABhC4U1yoIYXhNg,0,2025-02-26T16:02:11Z,False,True,UgzGdMNDcuauM7k3AX94AaABAg

I have a problem with how he structures his argument around why men leave a terminally ill partner 21% of the time, while women leave a terminally ill partner roughly 3% of the time. His argument can be broken down into 3 basic premises: 
p1- Love is conditional for satisfactory romantic relationships
p2. People experiencing a low satisfaction relationship are more likely to leave when the going gets tough (like financial stress, or partner illness) 
p3. When a partner falls ill the sick partner can no longer fulfill the conditions the caretaking partner needs to feel satisfied in the relationship. 
C1. Therefore, people leave unsatisfactory relationships because their ill partner is no longer fulfilling their needs. 

The problem is, that argument doesn't explain why men leave almost a quarter of the time while women are more likely to say. If it were logically consistent, then either women would also leave 20% of the time or men would leave 3% of the time.  It provides no insight as to why.

But a lot comes down to still being in a patriarchal society. Women are seen as caregivers and take care of most household duties. When they are ill they can’t perform those tasks and the men feel entitled to still receive that. When they don’t it’s a problem. They are entitled.

Also it threatens there idea of security long term if there man is sick. Also it's been known most women can't or don't want to provide financially for a man long term. It also when a man fails in a career or is very I'll, this shatters the image of her man in her head. This was said many times out of a woman's mouth and women do most of the breaking up in marriages or relationships. So the stat he threw out on that is complete bs. It's also been said many times ""that men stay in relationships way too long and women end them too soon or leave them too soon""! Most men if they do any breaking up it's usually for merit reasons. The woman is continually treating him bad or betrayed him really bad. Alot of women have even admitted to dropping there mate, husband or boyfriend even when the guy treated them very well and is a good or great guy overall. Excluding abuse, if a woman feels bored or thinks she's missing out on something one day they'll irrationally pull the plug no matter how good the guy is or how well he treated her.

If some women are pretty and shallow and are only in it for the money, then they are the wrong women to be chasing anyways and karma will eventually find them.

The relationship journey is idealized to the extreme. I remember when most couples met in school, neighborhoods, shared hobbies, fanilial friendships. Thus, it was highly likely they shared many things inc socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds and had wider support systems. They tended to stay close to multi-gegerational families. Women, more than men, have been brainwashed to believe they deserve not a suitable partner but a superior, even ideal partner. Extravagant engagement, endless parties, MY SPECIAL DAY, special venue, special gifts, etc. This continues into the marriage and esp with inlaw and sibling conflict. Every one is cheering to go No Contact every time there's a misstep or unpleasant relative. It is Me Me Me. I am not talking about abyse but everyday  annoyances. Men have their own issues. Just saying. Most reddit posts will confirm what i am saying. Women used to be perfectly happy for hubs to play golf or go fishing. Mom would play bridge or join a garden club. We had FOP,Shriners, Elks,Masons, VFW, Lions, Jiwanis--all places for men to find fellowship.. Women also had similar ways to gather. It seems women and. men are locked in a death struggle counting exactly who) how much the other contributes or doesn't. The swap between working outside moms and sahms doesn't seem to be happening. SAHM wants dad to take over the moment he walks in. I had a professional career which was demanding. My advice: Don't foment princess, idealistic behavior in your girls. And teach respect for women to your sons. Spend more time on values and less on the superficial.",@ellenthom34,UCFDtecBPHy9jNfOUGt6gHVg,1,2025-01-30T15:57:37Z,False,False,

Selective disclosure in relationships, based on relevance and emotional capacity, can enhance satisfaction and reduce conflicts.

Gender disparities in response to terminal illness highlight the conditional aspects of love.

Unrealistic societal expectations contribute to the decline in relationship satisfaction, with 80% of couples less satisfied than previous generations.

Attachment styles, like anxious or avoidant, influence relationship dynamics; self-awareness and personal well-being are crucial.

Strong relationships, married or not, impact personal happiness and health, underscoring the importance of autonomy and partnership needs.

Myths like resolving conflicts before sleep and the finality of infidelity are challenged, advocating for rational conflict resolution and openness.

Jealousy and digital infidelity require constructive communication and personal growth efforts to enhance trust and satisfaction.

Like good lord, when the dude says ""lower your expectations"", he's not saying ""give toxic people a chance"". He's suggesting, and I'll use modern lingo, if there's an insignificant ""ick"" about someone that can probably be easily addressed, but that person has many other redeeming and attractive qualities, maaaaaaaaaybe don't write them off immediately for something insignificant. No one is perfect. When he says ""lie to your partner"", he's not advocating lying about things that would be game-ending for the relationship, but moreso for things that don't need to be said that would simply create unnecessary tension. For example, you don't need to inform your partner if a person you find physically attractive walks by, that you found that person physically attractive. Unless you're both at a very comfortable place in your relationship with each other where you can both point out random people in a crowd and be like, ""Welp, they're hot"", then just keep those thoughts to yourself.",@flexgalaxy1268,UCktRgx_QuLSidvnaL68bzug,90,2025-01-30T15:19:00Z,False,False,

If being extraordinary comes off as being ordinary, then normal ordinary can come off as lazy or not talented enough to be worth someone's time.

2) The majority of divorces are filed by women and the bulk of those is women divorcing their husbands because of ""financial reasons"". Guess what...data shows those women started out earning their spouses and then bounced. 

3) Career women don't date down. A female lawyer wouldnt date a coffee barrista. But guess what a male lawyer would!  

It's always been the case that women date across and up whilst men date across and down! 

So stop blaming men!

Women handle their emotions poorly, but they TALK about them especially among themselves often. That is where the stereotype comes from.

2. Men dont leave because the woman makes more. That's a false stereotype. 

Men leave because the woman almost always words things in a way to make him her man feel financially inadequate.

That is the actual reason a man leaves, if he leaves.  Women often leave out of their stories how they indirectly tease or diminish their lesser earning husband or boyfriend, either through jokes or flippant remarks.

I say if one partner views another as lesser/not trustworthy, it reflects upon them just as much. Taking full responsibility seems like territory for heroes in times when the hero types we see feted as the best examples turn out to be equally human on various levels. But what do we expect?

​​⁠Having an honest conversations with your partner about what makes you feel financially inadequate would be a starting place. No one is a mind reader… 

Also doing the internal self reflection and addressing any inner emotional wounds around what makes someone feel inadequate is essential.

Women date up and equal because they are looking for someone who can provide for them during pregnancy and who makes them feel protected. During ancient times, physical strength and status (or money) were the most significant ways to protect women and children. And even so, today. Women date down because they are looking for youth and fertility but also for nurturing homemaking women (though most won't say that). That is why men can often date Mcdonald's workers while being millionaires. They are not dating to date the McDonalds worker. They are dating her because she could be a good homemaker and carries the physical and personality markers to make a good wife, or rather someone who is nurturing, caring, and comforting, who can take care of the kids and the household and will try to make her man happy after returning home from hunting which in turn increases the survival rate of the children and the man in ancient times (even if they did often participate times in tasks outside the home as well when needed). And it still does more so today. So no women don't date up, and men date down just because of culture. It is also a biological preselection process done over millions of years in survival and encoded in our habits. Hence why women date up, and men date down.",@alecsinger3364,UCk_71zHhgJrgmu9zBRLyydg,0,2025-01-30T20:40:29Z,False,True,Ugx1riSTYkCIYIHwHp54AaABAg

But why is that life successful and life level? 
With my grit and focus as high functioning autistic female artist since junior high to develop my talents. (A divorce from an unfaithful abusive person) and a continuous need to be self  sufficient and fearless while facing tragedy to the depths of my soul, I continue to commit myself with the integrity I have had since a little girl to carry on, push on, break barriers, do the impossible. Be brave. Be bold. As I am supporting myself. My dream of having a family and babies was ripped from me. My dream of being able to fully admire and trust, and adore.. to have a hero. My world as I knew it was shattered… so I push on and protect myself and continue to develop my career. 

And then I am faced with the men that say such things like he will punish me permanently. Though this time the red flag I see right away. 

Even the decent men make soooo many assumptions, negative assumptions negative views of me  simply because of what I have done with my life?! 

Men don’t admire and see me for who I am. Some or all except for one of them don’t want to know anything about me or my career, a craft in which I take seriously. 

But I don’t want someone that is considered on ‘my level’ I think it would be boring being serious all the time. I’m serious in my craft and in my profession. But I like to play. My level I guess is someone with my same career interests. Do I really want to go to museums etc and be all sophisticated. No! I want to go thrift shopping, or crazy fun things. I like to play hard. And my career is just one aspect, it’s not my silly aspect. So you can’t just look at someone’s career as the ‘level’ Many men will either not pursue or will punish. They think they know what I like. But I don’t want a man that will leave either because of assumptions. Even if you 100% say what you think due to my autistic nature then they don’t believe it! I don’t even know how to play games. 

I refuse to be with a man that treats me poorly in any way because of their perceived perception, more so after I am 100% honest.",@gloriahayleyk,UCn5QNv6g2PSPuQ2aWBLCpBg,17,2025-01-30T23:56:59Z,False,True,Ugx1riSTYkCIYIHwHp54AaABAg

Why are men this way all you guys described?
Ever think about that? They all money related? They all have a god conplex? They all want dominated and are obsessed with opressing?

You guys a bit immature to see that this happens but not why and how it came to this.. because you would have to selfreflect and blame perhaps woman partly too ..

60 to 80 years ago school was not like school is today. Plus before that it was another 20 years world war. And chaotic time. That in itselfs hase hase tons of rattail to it. 
Men/boys are not made to sit down for 6 or8 hours and shut up and dont move and dont be noice and so on.. it id literly punishmen and torcher for boys.
How you think you as woman would comw out 20 years later if you have been torchered .. right you would have propapbly incurable brain damage too.
And on top of it most mothers dont give love to their sons either. They also say shut up to up .. dont run.. behaive.. be quit.. dont have ""fun""basiacly.. so who is to blame if men end up like you guys described.. 
Ahh right.. selfrexlection or accountibility as your cryptonite right? 
Because my dad and onkels came all fine out.. when they wherent 24/7 in school and had not mothers who forbitten them to play. 
This in itself shapes the brain different .. school is and was made for indocrtrination we all know that.. but people often think the information in schools is for indocteination.. but that would be obvios woulndt it?
My grandpa got 104 years old and said school did not used to be that way back then for us boys.  
Also motherhood changed too.. you must work theseday.. that changes your own behaivior and brainstrukture also  .. negativly.. because you as woman are not made to work and be dissstressed all the time.. 
Our society hase a big toll on both of us.. but boys are getting left behind very very hard and you guys wounder and not rarely blame men for it. That in itself tells us that you guys wait for leadership it is built in your dna.. you will not change it or interfier even if you are selfeffected you will always blame men for it or men for beeing not ""smart"" enough or lazy or or or.. but this is what you guys wanted.. be able to go work foryourself and be independent(alone) creats this invoreament. But you are not seen it because you are profiting from it. And those who are seeing it those of you suffer yourself. But do not change anythink. Funny. ? 
Plus the elites they like it thisway.. they like it that they will have enough ignorant du mb /naive workers around who they can take advantage of. Also no till non competition for them.. forever big money..

A woman talking about money — even flaunting it — wouldn't faze him. Why? Bc they're likely in a similar wealth bracket. After 250K, you pretty much have the same sense of financial stability to not be worried about money. A woman showing off her success is how a wealthy man finds her in the 1st place. The reason wealthy men date these women is bc her obvious wealth reassures him that she won't exploit him and that she's self-sufficient. 

Furthermore, wealthy men who date wealthier women see her as a status symbol and an access point to broadening his social class circle. She provides a networking advantage. Wealthy men who date wealthy women have already vetted her personality and are comfortable with her wealthy flamboyance. Insecure men wouldn't even make it past the 3rd date, bc that discomfort would've caused them to dip. If you're in a relationship knowing she brags about money and it bothers you, then that's on you for continuing to pursue her. That's how I know you're full of it. You're not truly wealthy, you are either factoring in family wealth that isn't actually your own, or you're calculating the value of your overinflated stocks/assets as ""liquid"". But you're not SECURELY wealthy, bc your reaction reflects someone who is sensitive to the topic of money, thus you remain insecure. 

That's why your 1st comment said you'd resent her. Full stop. Not dump her (or ""eventually dump her"" like you later edited yourself). Just the resentment was all you advertised, bc your insecurity proves you depend on women for their resources. There's so many things you've said that expose you and it's crazy that you keep talking to give us more clues about your true circumstances. You're all smoke, no substance.

Actually the contrary - I’m curious and give a lot of space to their opinions and experiences - as a woman I actually defer somewhat in conversations unless it is something of absolute importance. Only often I might have an opinion, or contribute to conversations out of interest, and this might occasionally sound a little brainy if I have researched or thought about the topic. This seems to fly well and be acceptable outside of relationships, but not in them. They puff out their chests, they explain to me how terribly intelligent they are and how dumb I am, how my opinions are ‘bullshit’ and just demonstrating how unintelligent I truly am. How I don’t ‘get it’ in comparison to their refined and profound understanding of the topic. How academic learning isn’t really intelligence at all compared to having the innate intelligence that they do. I have been called a retard - presumably how I’m the opposite of intelligent in their eyes. I have had to listen politely as they mansplain to me a topic I have actually taught at undergraduate level, then agree that they must have the right of it, because if I’m seen to contradict them or add anything that they feel emasculates their intellectual superiority all hell will break loose. So yeah, this shit is real, and while it would be really unpleasant to lord a financial or other position over a man and use it to put them down, as a woman you don’t need to be doing that at all.

They have more than 4 kids together that already adults. no one brave enough to called out his behaviour. 

Now I feel like the husband have inferiority complex that to feel superior he ''emotionally'' abused his wife all these years. And the wife stay for the kids.

My grandma married a single father who co-parented 5 kids and a school janitor. She was just divorced from a drunk trunk driver  who never wanted kids. She was a single mom with 3 kids and needed ""support"" so she can work. Also at the time she needed a man to co-sign for her in every thing like a home, a car, a phone, credit cards. 

She had a Judge Judy personality and lost both her parents at 16 to get a grant for a bachelor's in business. She worked in real estate and had assets in the stock market. She went on to also be a the first female deputy in the city and maybe a state. She was mostly assigned to get female convicts back to the city for court/ jail time.

They raised 9 kids united and travelled the world with a time share in Hawaii and a house in two states. Grandpa was big in golf and woodworking. 

Think money only matters for survival and will cause conflict without having enough money or in debt. I think relationships only work when both people are mature. Maturity= reliable to self and reliable to the people who matter. The relationship should consistently be treated as someone who matters. 

The grandparents were reliable to each other in their outings/vacations - maintaining emotional bonds as a family and to each other, and home life. 

If Grandma was home- off for the day, she is doing chores and cooking. Grandpa did everything with the kids and having things set up when am grandma worked because his shift ended at 3pm. They were reliable to themselves with their individual passions/ self care. 

Just because Grandpa wasn't as educated or making as much money as grandma...he was respected for being a reliable and present father/ husband. He allowed grandmas 3 kids to call him ""dad"" as he raised them mostly. 

He was needed in the relationship because if he dumped her...she couldn't work all hours as an officer or in sales. She couldn't get a man to co-sign an apartment, car or credit for her. She would use up her savings to maybe be in a shelter to lose her kids.

Our past partners expected to always be superior to us without making the effort required to actually achieve that superiority. As a result, they became resentful, often making nasty remarks or even becoming violent. They lacked the capacity to process their emotions in a healthy way and instead channeled their frustration into a desire to bring us down rather than striving to reach the same level. In doing so, they expected their partners—us at the time—to diminish our personalities and success just to make them feel better about themselves.

Because in the vast majority of cases, in the context of a serious relationship and family, she will be the one taking the financial hit for at least 6-12 months  to bring those children into the world. How many countries offer Maternity pay which allows a woman to survive that period ? To cover housing, healthcare, bills without completely bankrupt ? America does not. UK does not. While most decent women I know don’t mind per say if her partner earns a bit less than her, no woman will want to have children with someone who earns significantly less because that equates to going from middle/ upper-middle class (when single) to abstract poverty (when in a relationship with children). And that is what happens when a man can’t pull his weight financially. Alternatively he can stay home and look after the child and do the home stuff but frequently men don’t as its beneath them. And then they get abusive and resentful. So what you are saying is that effectively men want to have their cake (not contribute financially) and eat it too (not do the domestic work and childcare).",@lillypencheva9987,UCua9_LODr57fYzqR4SSvpRw,0,2025-03-25T21:17:54Z,False,True,Ugx1riSTYkCIYIHwHp54AaABAg

Women, if you make a man feel inadequate, whether intentionally or unintentionally, then just like any other self-respecting human, he will lose interest. Just like women who cant date men who are more attractive physically or in-shape than they are—It brings up insecurities. 

However, those insecurities are the problem of the insecure person—in this case the man. But ladies, let’s not pretend that men are the talkative type or the type to bring up their feelings about feeling emasculated or anything less than adequate. Men have a lot of pride and quite frankly it is because they are expected to be supermen when it comes to everything they touch. But that feeling comes from other men *as well as women*. So understand that if you really want the rship, you yourself may have to take the reigns and lead the charge to his journey of self-discovery outside of being Mr Perfect. Not that you should do the work for him but to point out what you have observed (*lovingly and delicately*) so he may then begin to see himself and start doing the work for himself.

Also, while in this discussion, it would also be a perfect time to inquire about why it is he felt that way, like what was said or done to make him feel emasculated and to try to come up with a solution that works for you both.

But the key here is to always remember that men do thrive on the praise and admiration of their woman. It is men’s greatest source strength. If you cannot give it to him due to his financial success or career, praise him for what he is good at and what he does do that you appreciate from him. That makes all the difference in the world. Again, Don’t minimize yourself but dont bring him down and regularly uplift him. 

Those are some of the secrets to men. You dont have to understand it. You dont have to like it. But to keep a man, you MUST apply it.
Men don’t always understand women, but they accept what they cannot change and move accordingly as needed.",@garfield1114,UCte-LrHKNlB99GZb9Na1l_Q,0,2025-05-06T04:29:38Z,False,True,Ugx1riSTYkCIYIHwHp54AaABAg

It’s all borderline stupid. After all, we consider ourselves superior evolutionarily animals. Look at our closest counterparts. The males job, in most cases, is to focus on being an alpha male that can PROTECT. That’s it. The male lion trolls his territory for ~ 2-3 years till his cubs are large enough. His priority isn’t coming back to his “gurl” and taking her on a date. 

All these crazy ideals have destroyed the modern man and left us a shell of our former selves. On top of that, the rich people have put a penalty for leaving a relationship and introduced things like porn. Paying child support, or becoming senile due to watching porn, all creative ways to destroy men’s natural drives.",@paulgrewal4339,UCdRiLPioScXco3ElBUQfHUg,1,2025-01-30T14:45:47Z,False,False,

But it's also the problem. Men have to compromise so much today. 

For example, look into the whole Jona Hill (the actor) debacle. how his ex tried to get him cancelled.

He simply said (as was publicly leaked)  he didnt want her (his then girlfriend) hanging out with other men or doing bikini / lingerie shoots for magazines. 

Now...as a man, I can say thats completely reasonable. Would my wife like me hanging out with other women? No. 
Would I like her on display for the world to see like that? No. 

BUT..

So many women accused him of being abusive and thats controlling behaviour.  And that is exactly how a lot of young women are today. they want to do whatever they want to do. that's what feminism fought for right? 

And it's just a long growing list of problems men are seeing but women refuse to acknowledge and not taking accountability for their actions. 

So men cant win. Their standards are irrelevant to women. Say you're looking for a slim woman, you're told you are body shaming. Say you dont want a promiscuous woman, you're sl*t shaming, etc etc etc.  

So men have stopped caring. They're just walking away and looking for peace.  

And there will be no compromise for most. Half of women are going to be childless and single for their whole lives in the next few years and it's wont change...

Because what men want from women and what women want from men just isnt going to happen in this modern world.",@mindyourownbusinessgoogle9255,UC4wD7i7lbwzCrsPy9qm0pPA,0,2025-01-30T14:54:50Z,False,True,Ugwr_-ro3puD4YHG11Z4AaABAg

Values are e.g. the acceptance of the scientific method, of rational reasoning, growth, life, there exists an objective reality, good, evil.
A belief is climate change is man made, X is good, Y is bad, there’s systemic racism.
One doesn’t have to share the same beliefs, because if one shares the right values, one can find the truth, examine beliefs together, learn, and grow.
But you can’t have someone indoctrinated in postmodern relativistic political theory, who thinks truth is relative and serves a political narrative be together with a critical logical thinker who wants to pursue truth through science and Socratic dialogue. Nor could such a person get along with an Islamic religious fundamentalist.

So values ARE everything, beliefs are not. You can have productive, interesting fights about assumptive beliefs, you can’t have that about fundamental values.

Someone who doesn’t share my fundamental values can never accept me fully, and acceptance is key to any lasting relationship.",@ocoolar,UCGf6wMoYE4_OFP0RpRLwg5w,0,2025-01-30T12:57:10Z,False,False,

For starters, consideration needs to be given to the fact that the whole societal construct with regard to marriage/relationships has been largely created and imposed by men/the patriarchy - i.e. women needing to look and act a certain way, women not being allowed to vote/own property .. women not being allowed to take charge of their own bodies and make decisions for themselves. These things have been passed on and still exist in the male psyche and, whilst women are a little bit more emancipated in terms of being educated, having a career etc., the ideology behind these constructs still exist. Instead of women 'lowering their standards' - which by the way is an appalling way of looking at things - maybe men should raise their game for themselves first-and-foremost .... I am tired of the narrative spun by the likes of Jordan Peterson which holds women responsible for the loneliness of men ... the happiness and wellbeing of a man is not the responsibility/duty of a woman to resolve.",@maireadweaver8952,UC98nOAEE_h1QtOFYTLdx44w,2,2025-01-30T12:24:08Z,False,False,

As an archaeologist there is absolutely no evidence for a patriarchy 1000s of years ago .. women/females in prehistory have been largely written out by men in the 18th century  (even though we have 'Lucy') .. and women, for the most part, were not allowed to study at universities or actually get a an education.

You should also bear in mind that there have been birth restrictions imposed in some countries (by men) in recent times that has resulted in a demise of female births predominantly .. hence the 'population demise' you have referenced.

This is a reading comprehension problem. That 'alternative situation' is irrelevant to THIS situation because they clearly HAD NO SUCH AGREEMENT. 'Cheating with permission' is not cheating. They wouldn't have said it was cheating if it was agreed upon. You have no idea why the uncle did that nor who he is. The person who does, likely knows more than YOU do about their situation. He was wrong and disgusting for that and statistically men are more likely to do things like that because many are selfish and a lot of the times only value their partner's appearance and ability to have sex. Once that's out of the window, they leave. Because they're selfish and the women are replaceable to them. If you don't love someone for who they are, just what they look like and what they can do for you, they become replaceable. Hard truth. How is it NOT selfish to cheat because you haven't had sex in some time?? That's the definition of SELFISH. You are ONLY looking out for YOUR NEEDS and no one else's.

The answer is obviously somewhere in the middle.  Women’s standards are on average too high for a lot of men, and a lot of men aren’t doing enough to keep their women happy.  Either sex taking 0 responsibility and shifting 100% of the blame on to the other and giving up to stay single doesn’t help anybody in the long run. 

For men and women unwilling to even consider making any changes, it could make a lonely, childless future more likely for both which is not a good place.

I disagree with your statement.

Catfishing doesn't just have to be the over dressed-up inflated image we see when matching.
It can take forms of make-up, hair extensions ETC. We've all seen those videos of Thai lady boys remove one piece of their attire to reveal their true identity.

For men it could come in the forms of oversized t-shirts or hats to conceal their hair or lack thereof.

None of the above is wrong. It just isn't being honest 'catfishing' which I don't believe is conducive to starting any kind of relationship with strong foundations.

Islam isnt against divorce and actually makes it quite easy for couples to seperate if they aren't a fit. Muslims dont 'date' prior to marriage, so having a nikkah and being a married couple opens up that opportunity to really learn about your spouse. I'd personally alwags encourage premarital counselling, especailly in these cases. If either spouse grows to learn that their person isn't for them, divorce isn't meant to be a taboo thing. 

I'd also add that there are expectations of both spouses from a religious stand point that would encourage them to refrain from laziness etc within the marriage. Our bodies, mind, etc are what's referred to as an Ibadah (a trust/gift) which needs nurturing. Taking care of ourselves for the sake of our spouse is a form of worship, and one of the many reasons people fall in love with the religion.

Divorce levels within muslim cultures is so high because it is so accessible and often encouraged where needed. Its primarily cultures that make divorce taboo rather than the religion of Islam itself",@bredeleven4132,UCo_56z47MroQQ0ZIMP0ZEMQ,1,2025-01-30T11:41:39Z,False,False,

In modern times, It takes a little for women to wreak their relationships and it takes alot for men to end their long term relationships. 
Now the arseholes men who regularly cheats with different willing and knowning sex partners will do what their selfish arses will do and they are not 20% of soceity. Those are relationships that were never safe, no matter the situation. 

The number of men leaving the relationship when a woman gets ill is not because of lack of sex or lack of intimacy.
I was in hostipals alot as a kid and observed couples who got ill. When I visit hostipals and know couples in the community who are ill, I keep seeing the same thing. When a man walks away from their sick wife is vilified and ostracised from his community, even from his family, friends, unless they know his bad his wife is.

I always dig deep, rather than accept the loud mob spouting the usual bogeymen phrases and insults about their targets. I always look deeper which makes people uncomfortable when I do and often get called a creep for doing so by the guilty party. Sometimes it is both who are bad partners. 

The biggest reason why 20% of men walking away is because of men finally accepting that they are not going to keep their very bad relationship going. 
When men loves their partner which is regularly nourished, they are in full swing to support her despite knowing there will be a famine of sex. Men and women in boring relationships, those men do step up to help out hoping their boring partner appreciates them for sticking around with her. Hoping his wife will appreciate him and improve the relationship. 

The real reason for men splitting of long term relationships is the constant belittling, degrading and controlling nature etc of bad women in relationships (way more common than men and women admits to) which her bad behavious makes her gets ill far more harder than happier women, and the men (who sticks in with the terrible relationship with the bad women) do not wants to be up close and personal to spout more lies to continious bad eho about love, etc, knowing they have to continuously support her and that stress break him inside to walk away. While stress in a loving relationships when the wife is ill spurn him into action to support her.",@RealLimerickman,UCqdtcZWOn2gN3v_JlX7bjbA,0,2025-01-30T11:28:21Z,False,False,

You can be in relationships for years with them and they will not have revealed themselves until much later.   Also, there is the complicating factor of returning to situations in which you are familiar, which can ultimately lead to abuse.

My standards are pretty low. Just wanted a decent guy who I can love and treat well, honest, and caring. But sadly these traits are hard to see. 
I have been out with and dated many men that werent good looking, yet still ended up with dangerous men. No way I would lower my standards. I stay single to protect myself. Men are getting scarier and scarier these days.

I had a male colleague that treated me badly and then once he got to know me he was really nice. I nearly quit my job because of how horrible he was. 
We later became friends and I asked why he was so nasty, he said it was because I am pretty and he assumed that I would be the type of girl that takes advantage of men and go for a certain type. This was upsetting to hear that I was so badly judged based on my looks. 
He would love a relationship with me but even though he is extra nice now, the fact he was so horrible, controlling, manipulative, bad tempered and used many mind games for a long time and with a past of men doing the same, I can not forget how he was. He says he has changed but I am not too sure. I told him that i had decided a few years back that i am staying single due to past traumas and i wont be getting it a relationship with anyone again. He says he is happy as friends, as better than not at all. We have been good friends since but I tend to not see him too much as dont want to give wrong impression and I've said as much too. I never want to be that person that gives hope, so I remind him now and again. He seems good with it and it seems to work. 
So I just stick friendships with men and women and nothing more. 
No complications that way and much safer too. 

If by some miracle I found someone that I 100% trusted maybe but I'm too scared from past traumas to ever take that risk ever again. 
I like a man that is on same wavelength as me, sadly those men arent so forthcoming and neither am I. Usually the geek types is what I'm attracted too because they have similar interests and usually deep thinkers and very empathetic like me. But we are sadly too shy so many of us never meet or spark conversation. There was a geeky guy I liked loads. We flirted a bit but both of us were too shy to say we liked eachother. They i gave impression i wasnt interested because i got awkward around him the more i liked him. So we missed out. He is only guy I liked that much. 

This is why many single men and women dont get together, because of shyness.
Then the over confident men and women are out there taking advantage of the more meek men and women, then breaking their trust in having relationships altogether. So sad really.",@HumbleBee123,UCngKHtKGBOpdX1yQTKQr4yg,8,2025-01-30T13:18:15Z,False,True,Ugzd47Uk9jDl50WukBJ4AaABAg

It's just fascinating how it is evoked each time with such authority, as if it's the Qur'an for Muslims. Just goes to show how very human we all are, always in need of faith.

Yes you can have one for everything, but it won’t last as long as having a full set of tools at your disposal. No matter how well made it is. Requiring your partner to fit all the roles of a “village” has the same effect. It wears out/down faster, and is never as good as having a full social circle to bounce off of. You see this with children too. A lot of parents say it’s easier to have more children because they take care of, and play with each other. So it can be more effort to just have one, because the parent has to spend more time with the child filling that gap left by a lack of siblings of socialisation/play time. It’s not just a dating problem it’s a cultural problem, in an increasingly individualistic society. There has to be a tipping point where there is not enough culture left to individuate from.  So it all falls apart.

Most divorces do not occur among the rich. Higher incomes tend to stay together in spite of how celebrity divorces make it seem. 110 Billion in child support is back owed and never paid.

I met my ex husband when I was just a teenager. And I always told him that I never ever wanted to be married. Later on he became religious, and used that as an excuse to start nagging me to marry him. In the end I gave in, but I said. That I would marry him, and get a divorce after two months. Remember I was just a very young teenager!!  I did not get a wedding dress, just went to the registrar office in a mini dress, and no flowers either,. Got the 5 min ceremony and walked out again. I look extremely sad in all the photos of that day. So he KNEW from the beginning, that the plan was to divorce him! Well we had two kids, and I was thinking that I would wait until the kids had grown up. So when they were did, they started telling me to get mye divorce too. And when I finally did, they both congratulated me. And I`ve had nothing but love and understanding from them since. When I moved out, he found a new girlfriend, that was also religious. And mye adult kids liked her too. So everyone were happy. Now he is very poorly with Parkinsons, and living alone. So I`m doing his shopping and helping him out, once a fortnight or so. Just so my kids shall not have to do it!!  We have always been friends, but should definitely NEVER have been married or in a relationship. I`m enjoying single life to the full now though. Spending lots of time going out with friends, and having fun. Enjoying my freedom! 😄",@Annsunshine30,UCUU2RLyc4H3b3bGWYqMDlsg,5,2025-01-31T14:32:07Z,False,True,Ugy5xKnlvC2Oov9ZXH14AaABAg

She was the first woman in Quincy MA to drive a car and was taken to court by other women citing an antiquated horse and carriage law that prevented women from leading a team of horses - the judge threw it out. I could go on and on, but she was a trailblazer and loved life. Into her old age, she reverted back to living her “stage girl,” hours staying up late into the night and sleeping through the mornings.

It's a set for disaster and makes the explanation for why your community is in poverty because the men tend to only listen 👂 bashing of your women then stepping up for your status and community.

I’ve met many young adults and young middle age people (men and women) who do not want to go through the high cost of divorce especially in the US. The cost is devastating. And I partly blame  the family court process. Also, abortions have become on demand and substituted as a form of birth control. High abortion rates add to the lower population ( I’m not against abortion) I know women who had so many different relationships that would have produced babies but by the time they found their “ Mr charming” they could no longer bear children. Women have a very limited fertility span to safely have a baby while men can impregnate a female in their 80’s. These are only a few incidents that create the low populations we recently see. Some countries and cultures put more value on family. Those cultures have increased population rates. I am so lucky I have a great partner and we each do small and big courtesies for one another.

King James Version

1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.
23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.

Do you know what a 304 is? A 304 is a woman who sleeps around with any man and has absolutely no boundaries and acts absolutely cheap with no self respect

My stance is that women need to raise their standards and not have sex with men until she is secure and mature enough to be in a relationship. She needs to have self respect and set clear boundaries. Our great grand mothers used to be dignified with self respect 

So this is what I mean. You seem to have a problem with self respecting women given your response to the original comment. So if you are end up with a 304 don't complain when she absolutely breaks your heart. 

Or maybe you should also remain single because maybe you hate women? 🤷 Nothing wrong with staying single. At least you have a peace in your life 

And remember every woman had a father or lack of in her life.  So if you want to criticize women start with the ones the father who created her! Research shows that children who lack fathers have a higher tendency of having behavioral problems or becoming delinquent. Lack of fathers is a key predictor to how children will turn out.

""When lions mate with tigers, their hybrid offspring—ligers (lion father, tiger mother) and tigons (tiger father, lion mother)—often experience health issues related to hybridization.

Lifespan: Ligers and tigons can have shorter lifespans due to genetic complications, though this varies. Some live as long as their parent species, while others suffer from organ failures or growth disorders.

Fertility: Traditionally, male ligers and tigons are sterile due to a phenomenon called Haldane's Rule, which states that in hybrid offspring, the heterogametic sex (males in mammals, having XY chromosomes) is more likely to be sterile. However, female ligers and tigons have been known to be fertile and can produce offspring when mated with a lion or tiger.

Hybridization can also cause issues like gigantism in ligers, making them the largest of the big cats, which can lead to joint and heart problems.""",@PopMuzeic,UCWn5AwWiSQ_DDieJcsn5dlQ,0,2025-01-30T09:35:47Z,False,True,UgyFTTUAnVRQ4pnyeYp4AaABAg

I really didn’t hear anything of value for women on this video. For men either really. I met my husband overseas when I was living abroad. I had plenty of options when it came to dating……from different races. So, staying in a small town, with few dating partners, will only give you limited options. That’s might be ok for some, but you should seek out all your options and marry the best person. 
Black women have limited dating options because black men are extremely vocal about how much they hate us. They even write songs about and capitalize off of it on the internet. They profit through denigrating us. Black women are also exclusive. The majority of us only date and marry within our own race. Black men date out more than any other race of men, but also divorce the most. 
The issue though comes down to the male loneliness epidemic. Males keep up the same red/black pill rhetoric w/o understanding the world is different now. Women are different. And, women do far better w/o a relationship than males do. So, males continue to struggle. 
I’m very fortunate. My husband has always treated me like I’m the prize. He supportive, encouraging, taller than me, loving, etc. He’s never made me feel less than. He has put me at the center of his existence and has operated like this for decades. Y’all want to be the prize, but modern women understand that they are the prize too! Plus, we have options.

The biblical design for marriage is you marry young and you and your partner develop through life together. As desires and persons change your partner changes along with you.

I have also heard the stereotypical 'N** ain't ish' too, though usually after going through a negative experience (just my anecdotal stories). Outside of the context of race, men and women, especially after experiebcing something bad with the opposite sex, generally say negative things out of their pain.

I also think 'nerdy' people as a whole get looked over, but as a whole, people should just go where they are loved and where they find love. Too many choices can be detrimental in some circumstances, but it can also be rewarding to others in that they get to understand the different ways in which people show up and what aligns with them the most. In many cases, growing together results in growing apart, what works for some doesn't work for others.

However, I had many choices, but I still married black. I married the best guy. And, I disagree with you about the happiest couple. The Church has almost the same divorce rate as the secular world. And, as for marrying young, I don’t agree with that either. There’s a correct time to get married for each person. Men need to stop trying to control the narrative on what that time frame is. It’s not working for y’all. That’s why there’s 30 year old men who have never been kissed or had a girlfriend. The “The 40 Year Old Virgin” is now a documentary. The narrative you’re pushing isn’t working. Not even the one about single mothers. I had a stepfather. I know enough mothers, in their mid 30s and 40s, who  have gotten married. Males are literally harming themselves the most by trying to reduce/black pill women into bull crap. I could see if it worked, but it’s not working. And Tony, I appreciate you sharing your story. It’s a great example that black women need to start dating outside of our race as well. Ladies, just start watching those “Million Dollar Baby” glow up videos and get you a good man…….a good man from a 1st world country because passport bros are in the 3rd world countries living in dank one bedroom apartments. Plus, we have a lifestyle expectation to live up to. I lived in Japan for 2 years, but I’ve traveled to several other countries. I also had a decent job that paid in the top 25 percentile.

The denial of animal rights originates in the same supremacist thinking that has obstructed women’s rights. Some are quick to dismiss the suffering of females of other species as unimportant, but females – regardless of species – are the victims of systematic oppression.

Humans’ justifications for discounting other animals’ suffering and denying their basic rights are based on speciesism and are strikingly similar to those that have been used to disregard women’s suffering and disallow them their fundamental rights.

Being violated without consent isn’t just a human problem. Animal agriculture is entirely reliant on female exploitation. On farms, female animals are confined, forcibly impregnated, and killed so their ovulation markers, milk, and other body parts can be sold for human consumption.

Cows are wonderful mothers who, just like humans, carry their babies for nine months and nurse them, developing a strong bond.

Cows make milk for the same reason women do: to feed their babies. They produce milk only when they’re pregnant or nursing. On dairy farms, they are repeatedly forcibly impregnated through artificial insemination while being restrained in a contraption the industry calls a “rape rack”. In commercial dairy farming, their babies are taken from them within 24 hours of birth, and if they are female, they will enter the same cycle of misery as their mother. The male calves are killed or sold into the veal industry.

Mother cows often bellow and call out frantically for their young for several days or weeks after they’ve been torn from them.

The strain of continual pregnancy exhausts cows and often leaves them emaciated, with mastitis (infected udders), or lame. When they are worn out and can no longer produce high volumes of milk, they are sent to the abattoir and killed.

Farmers treat hens like egg-laying machines. They use light and food to manipulate their reproductive systems to induce extra laying cycles, forcing them to produce as many as 300 eggs per year – far more than the 10 to 15 their ancestors produced in nature.

Because of this, they often suffer from cysts, infections, ovarian carcinomas, and reproductive tumours and sometimes multiple eggs become lodged inside them – which is life-threatening. Their bones often shatter from osteoporosis because their bodies are forced to produce unnaturally high quantities of eggshells, day after day, without rest.

When their egg production begins to wane, these sensitive animals are shoved into cramped crates and endure a harrowing journey to the abattoir. Over a million chickens die in transit each year in the UK. Those who survive the journey are shackled by their legs before their throats are cut – sometimes while they’re still conscious.",@Animalsonlywantkindness,UCcz-JKI36W02lHaMDhfIF_A,1,2025-01-30T08:27:44Z,False,False,

Using the term partner acknowledges a level of commitment with maturity, this person is not simply someone's boyfriend/girlfriend they date for a few months in their twenties.

As constructive feedback, just one small thing I realized, after watching three interviews with the same guest:
There is quite some repetition in stories that are being told by the guest. Its great to repeat, though, in a small time scale of watching, it appears wasting time and nearly makes you shut off the interview.

Maybe you could take more focus on repeating guests for not repeating same stories, examples, facts.

I felt same when I heard that US President spotted be blamed had a affaire, while he was the No.1 figure on earth. how culture goes this insane!! 
I am ignorant of UK atmosphere well but I assume a large number of succeeded man likely to have affaires, as in japan too. You might find someone in UK or somewhere in Europe to make bonds as “new style of Chivalry” or “ Bushido”to share joy and help each other when things go wrong. it’s completely normal historically and bionically achieved person having such desire. Here in japan its not norm, but in my realm of “friends” , some has plural girlfriends, most of them have girlfriends or families or two.  It is so funny that the most of scientific researches Paul mentioned in this video I have used myself, now I found many evidences proved  me right!! thank you.

I think these matters ultimately goes to how you think about virtue, self-esteem,purpose,etc. but the problem is you can’t never ever savor its taste beforehand , and whether you would regret? It might feel like “oh, jus another fuok” or managing 3 families at once bring you another level? I’m not sure.
