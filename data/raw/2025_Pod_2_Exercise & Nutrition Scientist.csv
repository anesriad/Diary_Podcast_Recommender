For personal reasons, through my lived experience, I, as a hairy arsed 48 year old man, know more about menstruation and menopause and some of the connected areas, that would be expected and more than most men who aren't trained in this field.
It's never been a taboo subject for me.

I loved hearing things here which confirmed my knowledge and loved even more, learning new things.

I work in an office of mostly women and many of them are older than me.
I ended up in a conversation with some of them where I was able to explain some of the science around some of the symptoms. I noticed that most of them had shared most of the same symptoms.

One of the women in the office (but not in the conversation) complained to my boss about me being in the conversation.

Not about anything I said, but the fact I was in the conversation and was taking part and sharing.

I was told it was inappropriate.
I asked if it would be inappropriate if I talked about breathing or eating or sleeping as they were also natural bodily functions.  No, because men and women do those things.
I asked why it was ok for the women to talk to me about me being a baldie...  No answer.
I asked why it was ok for the women to talk about one of their husbands who had had testicular cancer.
I was told it wasn't ok. I then said that they shouldn't do anything about it as the woman whose husband it was, was getting support from her friend network of colleagues..

Utterly ridiculous that workplace politics might prevent people from sharing and supporting each other.",@actiondefence,UClXFw5B3SW79U1HS6B7UWLg,0,2025-08-21T18:22:05Z,False,False,

I am realizing the bleed pattern is also important, so I will start to take note of that from now on. Just a quick note for any rare cases like me out there:  Just because you hit LH high doesn't mean you will get a LH peak the next day.

It is only just this year that I have discovered what Peri-menopause is all about. Too late :( . At 35yrs I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I also ended up having to wear orthotics due to a stress-fracture in my toe. I discovered I had PCOS. I was always angry at my hubby. 2013 We had traveled overseas for 4 weeks, and I was not enjoying it like I knew I should have been, but didn't know why. By 2015 I was struggling with the job I'd been doing for 14yrs. Only sugar made me happy. I was diagnosed with depression and went on medication. It didn't seem to help as I was still struggling with work. I then got a frozen shoulder. I had trouble sleeping but yet needing to take 3 or 4 hour naps. I lost all interest with hobbies. In the last year I started getting hip pain while sleeping. I have not had a period in the last 4 months. FINALLY I discovered Dr Louise Newson via YT. I saw a Menopause Doc a week ago and am now on Estrogen and Progesterone. Puberty for me was the easy transition...Peri-menopause has been horrific!

My wife has tried fasting (which worked well for me) many times and always enden up feeling terrible. 

She's no wimp, so it was always confusing to me why fasting made her feel this way. Dr. Sims explanation about the differences in the hypothalamus and in available energy between the sexes, were mind blowing. 

I shared this video with my wife and initiated a future conversation on this topic.

And there is some evidence that it helps longevity, quality of life, and prevent other diseases (including some cancers). Yes, women live longer, but they also live worse than men at older age. So, I think Dr. Sims' discussion on HRT is very limited. Fact is that we do not much more research because existing research is limited and does often not included newer forms of hormone therapies (e.g., transdermal versus oral) and start of HRT. So, saying that HRT is limited to bringing a women through the phase of menopause transition (considering also that a part of women will experience symptoms for the rest of their life) is frustrating. The current position of the menopause society is that HRT does not need to be limited to only a few years but can be continued as long as it helps.

Stacey gives an example of a woman going to GP and being put on SSRIs. I went to GP with crippling fatigue, anxiety, brain fog, excessive weight gain. It had gotten so bad I had to quit my job in senior management. I was put on sertraline, it did absolutely nothing for me except make me constantly sleepy/headaches. I had told the GP I wasn’t depressed, but he thought we should try it. 
I asked about peri menopause, blood work came back and I was told I was not peri-menopausal. I’m 41. So, still don’t know why these symptoms appeared and have not subsided. 

After watching Stacey, I’m now wondering if I am indeed peri-menopausal after all. I’ve started to implement some of the Stacey’s principles and see how I go. I have not been eating breakfast for years, as I was watching all the intermittent fasting videos.

Me being 47 yo, for the last year or two I've been wondering about if I'm in menopause or not. The thing is that since I've had two periods where the bleeding lasted ca 6 months each, once around 35 yo and the last around 40 yo, and I'm mean large bleeds most days. The doctors couldn't find anything wrong. Eventually I was offered an operation called NovaSure, where they burn away the lining in the uterus, in combination with a hormone coil and a contraceptive implant. I did the operation and got the coil but sad no to the implant. I haven't had a bleed ever since so I don't regret it at all but now a days it had made me very unsure of what to expect from menopause and when it will ""show up"".

Sugar has been vilified to the point that all carbs became bad.  Next will be omega 3 fatty acids - foremost of which are the fish oils - ultra-processed!!!!  Both are a huge blockers for turning mitochondrial dysfunction around back to metabolic flexibility and efficiency.  Yes you may experience some health benefits because these PUFAs operate at different levels in the body but it builds up and is extremely difficult to detox.  Health influencers quickly jump behind products and supplements waving narrowminded science, often bias studies, and what not.

The solution is simple.  Get your connection back with the food you should be eating.  First take responsibility, be conscious and selective!  Determine what is food and what is not.  Be grateful and dump all the excess, mass-produced junk and eat a simple seasonal diet, quality genetics and home purified and processed.

I've enjoyed fasting until late morning, but Stacy notes subsequent bodily behaviours, which are all present. I do not work out like crazy, but mindfulness around my daily body movement is up there.  I am full-swing perimenopausal Gen X, and my head-body-energy has been reeling for some years and these last 18 months of exposure to fantastic women like Stacy, Marie-Clare, and Mindy Peltz have all contributed to my broadening knowledge.

I was entering perimenopause at the time, and her confidence inspired me to try following her recommendations. She advocated for high protein intake after workouts, creatine supplementation, and stopping fasting entirely. I followed her advice to the letter, but it didn’t work for me at all. Instead, it left me feeling worse—I gained weight, felt awful, and my energy levels plummeted.

This experience reminded me how important it is to find what works for your own body. While I respect her perspective, I decided to return to the practices that have transformed my life: ketogenic nutrition and fasting. I’m also a dietitian, and over the years, I’ve moved away from the standard American diet toward more natural approaches to health. Keto and fasting have been instrumental in improving my quality of life, and more recently, I’ve started exploring Ayurvedic nutrition, which is fascinating.

To be honest, my trust in her advice has declined over time. For example, in another video, she speaks with Dr. Mindy Pelz, a fasting advocate, and doesn’t disagree with her points. Yet, she’s been outspoken against fasting for people who engage in high-intensity sports, which creates an inconsistency in her messaging. Dr. Mindy promotes fasting as a tool for the general population of women, and from my own experience, I’ve found fasting to be a game-changer.

When I returned to fasting, my life improved significantly. I don’t agree with claims suggesting that fasting or keto can harm intestinal flora. In all my research—and I’ve done plenty—I’ve found the opposite to be true. Both fasting and keto have positive effects on gut health and metabolic function. There’s a lot of deep science behind this, but I’ll leave it at this: these practices are incredibly beneficial when done correctly.

I’ve also seen how individualized these approaches can be. My husband, who is an ultramarathoner, started keto three years ago. His performance has improved tremendously, though his version of keto includes more carbohydrates to fuel his high levels of activity. Keto is not a one-size-fits-all diet—it’s a flexible way of eating that can be adjusted to fit individual needs and lifestyles.

The same applies to fasting. It’s not just about skipping meals; it’s about understanding your body and tailoring your approach to suit your unique physiology. For me, keto and fasting aren’t just diets—they’re lifestyles that have improved my energy, strength, and overall well-being.

In summary, while I initially trusted this woman’s advice, my personal experience, research, and professional background have taught me otherwise. These tools—keto and fasting—are transformative, and I encourage anyone watching to explore what works best for them. Always listen to your body, do your own research, and trust what feels right for you.",@Outofmycastle,UCBQSrx0fQFrBj3c1vQnPp7w,0,2025-01-18T00:59:00Z,False,False,

I'm also vegetarian, but try to up my protein intake with protein shakes, beans, seeds etc. I'm becoming more concerned about the effect my amenorrhea might have on my general health.

In this episode, Dr. Stacy Sims discusses how mainstream exercise advice often overlooks women's unique physiological needs, especially during menstrual cycles. She emphasizes that women aren't just smaller versions of men; their bodies respond differently to training and nutrition. Dr. Sims introduces four key supplements tailored for women's health: vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and creatine. She also highlights the importance of adjusting workouts in sync with menstrual phases to optimize performance and well-being.

Most psychometric tests were originally based on a young male sample, because in the 50s, there were few college women to recruit. This rubbish about not using women because of menstrual cycles still persists in psychophysiology as well. When many researchers do use women, they only use women with menstrual cycles that work like clockwork, which means we have very little understanding of women's bodies in general, but particularly women who may have hormonal imbalances etc, This is so much why women's health is so poorly informed and there is so little help for us.

Our entire body is full of low volt current. As we wear shoes for a large part of the year, we will be static. It has been known for over 10 years that if we ground the body, the body immediately comes back into balance. Do a google search and see for yourself. There are several examples of both wound healing and pain disappearing immediately after you ground yourself. There are pictures of the blood clumping in the veins. And immediately after grounding, the blood flows again as it should. Remember we are not made with shoes 😉😁 After I gained this knowledge, it became very logical to me that walking around being static causes the whole body to be out of balance.

My problems began around 18 years post menopause though I had a known B12 insufficiency for a few years, I began having systemic inflammation, joints, tendons, internal organs, beginning with my cervix, I had a partial hysterectomy. My doctors would not listen. For them I had arthritis and lack of pelvic muscle. Then I literally fell apart my left knee collapsed and I had urinary problems. Found help for my knee and then my internal ligaments and tendons gave way. When I found a new urologist I had NO testosterone and insufficient estrogen causing inflammation and ligament weakness. I had been told I could not take hormones, due to a family history of breast cancer and I am now wondering what were they thinking. What does it matter if I prevent breast cancer, but literally fall apart and am unable to move due to joint pain and inflammation and total muscle atrophy. I was strong at 50 I could dead lift 200 lbs. and I am 5' 9"". I had another more difficult surgery, I am now on hormone therapy, but with all the recovery I have gained weight and I am weaker than ever. I am a medical professional and all I see is most people are not getting the help they need especially if they are post menopause. We are just old and dying and should get used to it.

As a woman a lot of these topics I have intuitively assumed since a teenager. However, every gynecologist just wants to put you on birth control, for everything. Not even a mention of lifestyle changes and stress levels, never. 

I was very recently diagnosed with PCOS, I am 24 years old. I asked my obgyn numerous times to test my hormone levels and she refused, even after this diagnosis. 

I have struggled with irregular cycles and hormone imbalance since a child, I had early puberty. And have been in sports since 6 years old. 

All I have ever been offered is birth control. 

Doing the best I can to change my habits and diet. You genuinely can feel your body and mind being in chaos and you’re just told there’s nothing you can do except take birth control.

The Female Physiology in Exercise

Key Differences: Women’s hormonal profiles—puberty, reproductive years, pregnancy, perimenopause, menopause—impact training and nutrition significantly.

Male-based research dominates sports science, often generalizing findings to women.

Girls often drop out of sports by age 14 due to physiological changes (e.g., Q angle, hip widening) and lack of guidance.

Impact of the Menstrual Cycle:

Follicular Phase (Day 1-13): Lower hormones; more resilient to stress, better glucose sensitivity. Ideal for high-intensity training.

Luteal Phase (Post-Ovulation): Progesterone rises; increased insulin resistance and core temperature. Focus on moderate training and recovery.

Progesterone and estrogen influence ligament laxity, increasing injury risk around ovulation.

Training and Injury Prevention

ACL Injuries in Women:

Women have a 3-4x higher risk due to wider hips (Q angle) and quad dominance.

Prevention: Strengthen the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes) and incorporate lateral movements and single-leg exercises.

Resistance Training:

Essential across all ages for fat mobilization, muscle building, and improving metabolism.

Protein intake post-exercise: 35g for women (vs. 20g for men) within 45 minutes.

Heat and Cold Adaptation:

Women require more time in saunas for equivalent cardiovascular benefits.

Optimal cold plunge temperature: 15°C for women (vs. near-freezing for men).

Nutrition for Women

Fasting:

Women should avoid prolonged fasting (e.g., 20-hour fasts) due to hormonal sensitivity and metabolic impact.

Overnight fasting (dinner 2-3 hours before sleep, breakfast upon waking) is recommended.

Carbohydrates and Protein:

Women’s bodies require more carbohydrates to support hormonal and muscular functions, particularly during high hormone phases.

Pre-exercise fueling: 15g protein + 30g carbs to prevent lean mass loss.

Supplements:

Creatine: 3-5g daily for brain health, muscle performance, and gut integrity.

Vitamin D3: For muscle function, recovery, and overall health.

Omega-3: Particularly valuable for inflammation management in perimenopause/postmenopause.

Iron: Monitor and supplement if ferritin levels are below 50 (ideally 100 for active women).

Keto Diet:

Not recommended due to its negative impact on gut microbiome diversity, which is crucial for hormone metabolism.

Practical Takeaways

Adapting Training: Align workouts with menstrual phases for optimal performance and recovery.

Injury Prevention: Strengthen posterior chain and practice proper mechanics for landing, jumping, and cutting.

Dietary Adjustments: Tailor meals and supplements to hormonal fluctuations and individual needs.

Recovery Windows: Women’s metabolic recovery post-exercise is shorter; prioritize nutrient intake within 45 minutes.

Fasting: Focus on circadian-aligned eating patterns rather than prolonged fasting.",@MS-zl4nr,UCtIsGaFEFJ2tKVwG3_lsztg,3,2025-01-10T05:20:20Z,False,False,

I wanted to help out some of the fellow commentators asking: Why did keto work for me then? What about other experts contradicting Dr. Sims? Why does this and that work for me well, then? Her statements must be false. Scientific data and statistics give a insight on the population level. These are geralisations that do apply to the average yet not to every single individual. If you follow advice, if the science behind it was robust, it is likely it will help you (much more likely then science that was only based on men or was conducted with small sample sizes etc.) yet it is never a guarantee. Please note as well, that you might have underlying conditions, that make you react differently. Every body is unique in a way, and science tries to get as close as possible to the generalised population in this case, refreshingly the female part of it (or the forogtten other half). If other experts give contrary advice, please have a look at the literature they are basing their statements on. They might very well be based on males only or not underlined with scientific results at all. And then, sometimes it might be just so, that we do not yet have sufficient information to give a solid advice at all - then go and try that suits you best.

It’s important research, as we’re still socialised to see physical differences (between male and female) as reason to differentiate against women as the ‘other’ across all areas of society, because the ‘default’ human has been male, historically (especially strange when technically the majority of humans are female, but that’s patriarchy!). Ironically, I feel like knowledge about biological sex  differences can only highlight
diversity in/understanding of humans (including the differences within men), and we can reach a place where we see each other as  human first, and and then biological sex is just one class/attribute, within this. Then, our physical needs can be addressed where required (not assumed), and we all reach a baseline of basic health, no matter who we are.",@cassrhem,UCYR40Cb4Y-bCcjEb5SLzuKw,0,2025-01-09T07:44:52Z,False,False,

Older post menopausal women are experiencing masses of societal and self-inflicted pressures. I am so glad that you asked because NO ONE speaks about post-menopause, and especially the first three years, which continue to be painful. You don't just get out of menopause, even after one year of not having your periods. I am going through it and it is debilitating still. I do not take HRT. I wish you could create an episode focussed on all the challenges that women face post menopause - from becoming invisible to men who choose to look at younger women, to being put inside a box (grand mother), to sexual drive, nutrition, exercise etc.  We are the most underserved segment of the population.

Perhaps it’s just in this interview, but calling keto and carnivore… and even paleo “crazy diets” came off as very dismissive given the core of what is being discussed is how to be healthy, especially for women. So many people have used these diets in a therapeutic way to manage chronic conditions, especially autoimmune ones, with great success. I think it’s fair to say that perhaps keto or carnivore should not be long term ways to eat for most people, but I don’t think it’s fair to dismiss them completely. Also…. The reality is most people in modern western countries, the type that may watch this show or perhaps may be one of the overweight folks who can barely walk, do not know what to eat.

Our culture is a shame and as a woman I would rather have lived BEFORE the civilization.
It is not OUR culture either, it is MALE culture more exactly where all the scholars all the mysogynist pathetic scientists and artists and philosophers shaped and deformed OUR world to only fit for men.
Shame on this and no matter I am a woman, I feel ashamed to be living in this era of humanity. Besides some changes it is as biased , unbalanced, sick mentally and spiritually as it was at the start of patriarchy.
I could just cry because it was my world too.. but the male dominance deprived the majority of women if not all of the feeling of being part of life. Ironically… cause women know much more about life and giving life in general.
Shame again but good podcast video.
I am sorry I ended my subscription a few yrs ago but I could not watch the all the male self obsessed videos and “I want to live forever and I am a strong man” types of videos any longer where you could sense they have nothing to do with cycles of life, they negate death, decay, natura processes, female bodies all in all.., and just drop dead boring.

I am glad you invite women as well for a time now, because u being a man I wouldnt even expect you to do it.. mostly because I no longer expect anything from men but thinking only of themselves… last couple of millenia just proved this to be the case unfortunately.
Also the reason of me being as disappointed as this is because I too had to bear some very bad consequences of being mal treated both medically and from a human point of view just because I am a woman… therefore a secondary being..
Women do not support each other cause they know much more about how to live in marriage now than about their own bodies and psyché. It has become a tendency and fashion to hate women as women too not to look weak I guess or vulnerable in this pretentious, violent world, and to run to a man for remedy for anything than forming women support groups in case of specific women-related issues… again because women have long been shamed about their bodies, bodily functions, even for TALKING about personal matters and being EMOTIONAL. So ad much as people think women speak about everything with their girl friends… it is again a myth really, even our mums in my generations DIDNT even DARE speak about sex, menstruation, etc because these were treated as taboo and shameful topics… our OWN bodies have been taboo.

So many millions of women have been and are suffering because of these harmful and poisonous religious-cultural female shaming even today.",@mse5739,UC9Id1ZoVnRCS2Q1P3uNYgLw,0,2025-01-08T21:23:18Z,False,False,

- Women often find typical fitness and dietary plans ineffective due to unique physiological changes across their life stages.
- Dr. Stacy Sims advocates for personalized fitness and nutrition strategies tailored for women, addressing the shortcomings of male-based sports science data.
- Puberty brings physical changes that affect girls' participation in sports, with a significant dropout rate by age 14 due to lack of tailored support.
- Tailored exercise and nutrition plans can enhance women's health and performance by factoring in menstrual cycle variations and hormonal changes.
- Menopause introduces challenges like weight gain and muscle loss, requiring a focus on resistance training and adequate protein intake.
- Misunderstandings about diets and supplements are addressed, promoting evidence-based approaches for women's health.
- Research and advocacy are closing the gender gap in sports science, empowering women to make informed health and fitness choices.

One thing to mention, though, is that you cannot have a high fat AND a high carb diet (aka, lots of fruit and veg) because that is a sure fire way to gain weight. We seem to have to choose.

I do try to keep an open mind, stay flexible, and know we’re going to learn more as we focus on women. I remember many years ago…maybe I was 50 and told my doctor (who had me on hormones at the time)…that I felt my metabolism was changing. She told me metabolism doesn’t change… gave me lubricant for sex is all. We don’t know a lot of what we need to know. Especially gut. I later on a few years got breast cancer.

But the view of strength training was different in Sweden where I grew up. I started strength training and running at 16 in the early 80s. there was a women's only gym and men's only gym with saunas. They where very helpful there showing how to train and personalizing a program for each person. Later in the 90s I went to a Nautilus gym that where for both sexes and had an indoor and outdoor pool also and sauna with separate lockers and sauna of course.

The debilitating symptoms of estrogen depletion such as urogenital and musculoskeletal issues, and so many more, do not just miraculously resolve at a certain point. (Surely she’s aware of Estrogen Matters by Dr. Avrum Blumming.) Replacing the missing estrogen is like replacing missing thyroid hormone, which nobody seems to have a problem with. The fact that she was associated with investigators on the WHI and didn’t make a point of how the results of that study were misreported, overblown, do not apply to younger women and involved synthetic hormones that aren’t even prescribed anymore is enough to make me doubt all the other truly interesting information she shared. Women do not use HRT to try to look like they aren’t aging. That is an old assumption that contributed to the misrepresentation of the WHI study data. We use HRT to feel like ourselves and be able to live as functionally, productively and happily as possible in the final third of our lives. There are great docs on social media like Mary Clair Haver, Corrine Menn, Vonda Wright, Louise Newson, and Kelly Casperson who provide truly valuable and up-to-date information for menopausal women.

#### 1. **Women’s Physiology is Unique and Often Overlooked**
   - Traditional sports science research has predominantly focused on male physiology, leading to generalized recommendations that often fail to address women’s unique needs. Women experience hormonal fluctuations throughout their lives—puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause—which significantly impact their fitness, metabolism, and overall health.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Women are not smaller versions of men. Their physiological differences, such as hormone profiles, muscle morphology, and fat distribution, require tailored approaches to exercise, nutrition, and recovery.

#### 2. **Hormonal Fluctuations Impact Exercise and Nutrition**
   - The menstrual cycle plays a critical role in how women respond to exercise and nutrition. For example:
     - **Follicular Phase (Days 1-14)**: Women are more resilient to stress and can handle higher-intensity workouts. Carbohydrate and protein intake can be higher without adverse effects.
     - **Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)**: Progesterone levels rise, increasing core temperature and reducing heat tolerance. Women may need more carbohydrates and protein to support energy needs and recovery.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Adapting exercise and nutrition to the menstrual cycle can optimize performance, recovery, and overall health.

#### 3. **Supplements for Women’s Health**
   - Certain supplements can support women’s health, especially during menstruation and menopause:
     - **Creatine**: Improves muscle performance, brain health, and gut integrity. Women have lower creatine stores than men and can benefit from 3-5 grams daily.
     - **Vitamin D3**: Essential for bone health, muscle function, and recovery, especially in winter or for those with limited sun exposure.
     - **Omega-3s**: Reduce inflammation and support cellular integrity, particularly during peri- and post-menopause.
     - **Iron**: Many women are iron-deficient, which can lead to fatigue and poor performance. Supplementing with high-bioavailability iron can improve energy levels and oxygen-carrying capacity.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Targeted supplementation can address common deficiencies and support women’s unique physiological needs.

#### 4. **Exercise Adaptations for Women**
   - Women’s bodies respond differently to exercise due to factors like muscle fiber composition, Q-angle (hip-knee alignment), and hormonal influences:
     - **Strength Training**: Women can build lower-body strength as effectively as men but may struggle with upper-body strength due to differences in muscle morphology.
     - **ACL Injury Prevention**: Women are 3-4 times more likely to suffer ACL injuries due to wider hips, quad dominance, and hormonal influences. Strengthening the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes) and incorporating lateral movement exercises can reduce injury risk.
     - **Heat Acclimatization**: Women’s heat tolerance varies with their menstrual cycle. During the high-hormone phase, they may need more time to acclimatize to heat.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Women should focus on strength training, injury prevention, and adapting exercise intensity to their hormonal cycle.

#### 5. **Nutritional Differences Between Men and Women**
   - Women’s nutritional needs differ significantly from men’s due to hormonal influences and metabolic differences:
     - **Caloric Needs**: Women’s hypothalamuses are more sensitive to nutrient density, making them less responsive to low-calorie or low-carb diets. Fasted training can be detrimental, leading to muscle loss and hormonal dysfunction.
     - **Protein Timing**: Women should consume protein (35 grams) within 45 minutes post-exercise to maximize muscle protein synthesis, while men have a longer recovery window.
     - **Keto Diet**: Not recommended for women due to its negative impact on gut microbiome diversity, which is crucial for hormone metabolism and overall health.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Women should prioritize nutrient-dense diets, avoid fasting, and time protein intake to support recovery and hormonal balance.

#### 6. **Menopause and Perimenopause: A Critical Phase**
   - Perimenopause (starting around age 35) and menopause (average age 52) bring significant hormonal changes that affect metabolism, body composition, and overall health:
     - **Symptoms**: Increased body fat, poor sleep, mood changes, and insulin resistance are common. Women may also experience a decline in gut microbiome diversity and bone density.
     - **Exercise Recommendations**: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance training are crucial for maintaining muscle mass, improving insulin sensitivity, and managing weight.
     - **Nutrition**: Higher protein intake (1.6-2.2 grams per kg of body weight) is recommended to counteract anabolic resistance and support muscle and bone health.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Women in perimenopause and menopause should focus on high-intensity exercise, increased protein intake, and gut health to manage symptoms and maintain quality of life.

#### 7. **The Importance of Bone Health**
   - Women are at higher risk of osteoporosis due to hormonal changes that affect bone density. Resistance training, weight-bearing exercises, and adequate vitamin D intake are essential for maintaining bone health.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Strength training and proper nutrition are critical for preventing bone loss and reducing the risk of fractures, especially during and after menopause.

#### 8. **Sleep and Circadian Rhythms**
   - Women experience more sleep disruptions due to hormonal fluctuations, particularly during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and perimenopause. Men, on the other hand, have a later melatonin peak and are less affected by hormonal changes.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Women should prioritize sleep hygiene and consider adjusting their routines to align with their circadian rhythms, especially during hormonal shifts.

#### 9. **Sociocultural Barriers and Lack of Education**
   - Women’s health topics, such as menstruation, menopause, and hormonal health, are often stigmatized or overlooked in education and healthcare. This lack of awareness can lead to misdiagnosis, inadequate treatment, and unnecessary suffering.
   - **Key Takeaway**: Open conversations and education about women’s health are essential for empowering women to take control of their health and well-being.

### Conclusion
Understanding the unique physiological and hormonal differences between men and women is crucial for optimizing health, fitness, and performance. Women’s bodies are not simply smaller versions of men’s; they require tailored approaches to exercise, nutrition, and recovery that account for hormonal fluctuations, life stages, and specific health challenges. By adapting exercise routines, prioritizing nutrient-dense diets, and addressing common deficiencies, women can achieve better health outcomes and improve their quality of life. Additionally, breaking down sociocultural barriers and increasing education about women’s health will empower women to make informed decisions and advocate for their well-being. Ultimately, embracing these insights can lead to a more inclusive and effective approach to health and fitness for women at every stage of life.",@MrQuadcity,UCG9HRS5KUtWshdSyNxWsqRA,1,2025-01-07T18:17:06Z,False,False,

I know that they can't body build during that time, but they still have to eat, exercise, sleep, work, recover, possibly breast feed, while hopefully dropping the baby weight ... Feels like a lot of hormone related information is being totally skipped. Not heard one expert on the show even mention pregnancy, recovery, and getting back to normal. I wonder if we get so much more cancer now because female bodies are designed to be growing these babies all the time, but instead of doing that we don't let them because it's hard, expensive, and we are busy. So do we end up growing more cancers instead?",@xodroidx,UCwVcujQMamk8lfUAoQibYTQ,1,2025-01-07T14:22:33Z,False,False,

I have a vibrant life, an athlete, sudden lack of wellness at age 33 due to extreme change in my  hormone health. I began bioidentical HRT with tremendous success, a life-changing choice for me. I stopped the HRT for over 15, then my health and wellness plummeted differnt from my 30's yet quite debilitating. Physicians didnt hear me and were telling me that its ""just aging"". Well i chose to try HRT again, as a post menopausal woman, with resistance from provider, yet with fantastic results. My health chalanges have subsided and I'm very grateful to be feeling well and vibrant again. For me personally a choice that relieved serious suffering and provided me with the return of wellness. 

For me personally, depleated hormones resulted in multipal painful and debilitating symptoms and suffering, which is something i wouldn't wish on any of us.

When training during different phases of the menstrual cycle, women should consider specific adaptations to optimize their performance and recovery.

Strength and Performance: Women tend to be strongest during the follicular phase, particularly from around day 6 to day 13 of the cycle, when estrogen levels begin to rise. This is an ideal time for higher intensity and resistance training as the body is more capable of handling stress and performing at peak levels 39.

Stress and Recovery: It's important to monitor stress levels, as both physical and emotional stress can impact the menstrual cycle. A missed period can indicate that the body is under stress, which may be due to excessive training or other life stressors. Therefore, adjusting training intensity and incorporating recovery strategies is crucial 40.

PCOS Considerations: For women with conditions like PCOS, focusing on resistance training can help regulate cycles and manage symptoms. It's essential to monitor heart rate variability and adjust training intensity accordingly to support blood glucose levels and overall well-being 41.

By aligning training with these physiological changes, women can enhance their performance and maintain better overall health throughout their menstrual cycle.",@QualityIsQueen,UCyzi8RELED8giVHdS7SkRCg,0,2025-01-06T21:58:38Z,False,False,

It was too painful to even sit on the swing.  And whereas I used to do 60 sit-ups in 60 seconds when I was younger, I could no longer do sit-ups after giving birth to my first child because my tailbone shifted and caused pain to rock on while doing sit-ups. Additionally abdominal diastasis made it difficult to do sit-ups, and so I stopped completely.  It didn’t matter that I went back down to my pre-pregnancy weight two months after giving birth. My body wasn’t the same, and everything I knew about working out no longer was comfortable to do postpartum.

If you haven't tried it yet I would encourage you to talk to your doctor about it.

Do not be afraid of the hormones. We need them, Estrogen protects our brain, skin, bones…the key is to not use synthetic versions. Stay away from Premarin and Progestins. Bioidentical estrogen like the patch or pellets are the right choices. Real progesterone at night will help with sleep. Testosterone helps us not to lose strength, energy, and libido and just feel better overall. I’m 61 and been on this road awhile. It takes time to learn your body and the best dosages for optimal health. Stay away from a dr that wants to limit estrogen or will only give the estrogen pill. The pill is not assimilated well and will eventually not be enough. FSH on lab work tells about estrogen. Best is under 10. Optimal is under 5. I’ve done tons of reading and studying. If the dr says Estrogen is given at the lowest dose and shortest amount of time then find another dr. I get pellets. I was at one dr that wanted to give Testosterone at doses like 125mg which they say is low but that’s way too high for me. He would not give Estrogen over 18mg. I found another dr. I now usually get about 25-30mg Estrogen and 65-85 Testosterone. Everyone is different. I will never stop taking my bioidentical hormones. There is help out there. Insurance isn’t going to pay for much so don’t expect it. I pay $350. every 3-4 months for pellets. Progesterone is about $30. per bottle but I don’t take it every night because it can make me feel sluggish during the day if it builds up too much. I also take desicated thyroid called NP Thyroid. It is a prescription. It is a balancing act also. If estrogen is higher then my dose of thyroid will be higher.  My dr and I are a team. She trusts me to make decisions on dosages and she gives her advice. A good Dr will listen and think outside the box.

When I first went in for my yearly, my doctor checked the amount of eggs I had left and she said they were low. She then went on to place me on a low dose birth control for the symptoms that had started. I was having very painful cramping and ovulation which I had never had before. I had always had very easy periods with not much discomfort. In fact most of mine lasted like 4-5 days only. The bc did help the pain and I had been fine all the way up until about the last year and a half where now even with bc I can feel pain and cramping again, but at 50 I’ve noticed that my breast are starting to swell again with cycles and I’m getting bloated as well. The funny thing is that I’ve been on the light dose bc and don’t have a period with them. So haven’t had a period in like  7-8 years due to the bc. She said that at about age 52 she will take me off the bc for a couple of months and let my levels get back to what’s normal for me without the bc and then check my levels. She said if I would like to do it sooner to stop my pills for a couple of months and then come in and have blood drawn.",@mandykaminsky1275,UCD_HsbQTLpXmcQNswvvYovA,0,2025-01-12T20:59:08Z,False,True,Ugz2jXM1dr8v2TAj0Gd4AaABAg

Praying and hoping that you will be better. I think am entering perimenopausal stage and I have been feeling horrible 2 weeks b4 my menses. I used to have only 2 weeks in a month or sometimes just a week that I feel alive and not surviving through life. Last month, I started working towards balancing my hormones by eating foods that support my hormones in each stage of my cycle (follicular and luteal). All the symptoms I have been feeling vanished and I operated like a normal human being last month. No supplements (and am not saying they are bad and shouldn't take) and no meds. So I would recommend you do this and hope it helps. Am barely 35 and I can't imagine what at 42 you have been feeling bearing in mind you are nearing menopause considering what I have been experiencing the last couple of months.
Menopause doesn't have to be this hard making us lose desire to live and then the people who are supposed to help and enlighten us make it even worse. 😢

This not only speaks to the real issues women face aside from health and physiology, but In fact this topic goes so much further! 

Did you know that the test dummies have all been created after the anatomy of the male? So all the testing completely ignores how crashes would affect female physiology. It wasn’t until recently the first female test dummy was created!

• Creatine:

Ideal daily dose: 3-5 grams once daily for maintenance.

Loading phase: Some people choose to do a ""loading phase"" when starting creatine supplementation to saturate their muscle stores more quickly. This typically involves taking 20 grams of creatine per day (divided into 4 servings of 5 grams each) for 5-7 days. After the loading phase, you return to the maintenance dose of 3-5 grams per day.

Best form: Creatine monohydrate.

Worst form: Creatine ethyl ester.

Men vs. women: Both benefit; women may see enhanced benefits during perimenopause/menopause.

How Creatine Helps:

ATP Production: Creatine plays a crucial role in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy source for muscle contractions. During high-intensity exercise, ATP is rapidly depleted. Creatine helps replenish ATP by donating a phosphate molecule to ADP (adenosine diphosphate), converting it back to ATP. This allows you to maintain high-intensity effort for a slightly longer duration.

• Vitamin D3:

Ideal daily dose: This is where location matters. Here's a breakdown based on general recommendations.

Warmer climates (e.g., Southern Europe, Australia): 600-1000 IU (15-25 mcg) daily may be sufficient for most people with regular sun exposure.

Colder climates (e.g., Northern Europe, Canada): 1000-2000 IU (25-50 mcg) daily is often recommended due to less sun exposure, especially during winter months.

For deficiency or specific conditions: Higher doses (up to 4000 IU or more) may be prescribed by a doctor to correct a deficiency or manage certain health conditions.

Best form: Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the preferred form as it's more effective at raising vitamin D levels than D2.

Worst form: Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is generally less effective.

Men vs. women: Both men and women need vitamin D. Women may have increased needs during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and adequate vitamin D levels are crucial for bone health throughout a woman's life.

• Omega-3s:

Ideal daily dose: Leading experts often recommend a combined EPA and DHA intake of at least 250-500 mg per day for general health. Higher doses (1000-2000 mg or more) may be recommended for specific conditions like cardiovascular health or managing inflammation.

Dietary Choices: People who consume fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines) 2-3 times per week may obtain sufficient omega-3s from their diet. Vegetarians and vegans may need to rely on algae-based EPA/DHA supplements.

Best Form:

EPA and DHA Content: The most crucial factor is the amount of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in the supplement. These are the primary omega-3 fatty acids with the most significant health benefits. Check the supplement label for the combined EPA and DHA content per serving, not just the total fish oil or omega-3 content.

Triglyceride (TG) Form: Omega-3s in their natural triglyceride form are generally considered to have better bioavailability (absorption) than ethyl ester (EE) forms. Look for ""TG"" or ""natural triglyceride"" on the label.

Phospholipid Form: Krill oil and some other specialized omega-3 supplements contain omega-3s bound to phospholipids. These may also offer enhanced absorption, although more research is needed to confirm if they are significantly superior to TG forms. They are generally more expensive.

Purity and Testing: Choose supplements from reputable brands that undergo third-party testing for purity and contaminants like mercury, PCBs, and dioxins. Look for certifications from organizations like the USP (United States Pharmacopeia) or NSF International.

Sustainability: Consider the source of the omega-3s. Look for certifications from organizations like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) to ensure the fish oil is sourced sustainably.

Worst Form: 

Oxidized or Rancid Oil: Omega-3 fatty acids are prone to oxidation (rancidity), which can reduce their effectiveness and even produce harmful compounds. Avoid supplements that smell fishy or have an unpleasant odour. Look for products packaged in dark, opaque bottles and stored in a cool, dark place.

Low EPA/DHA Content: Some supplements may advertise high total omega-3 content but contain very low amounts of EPA and DHA. Pay close attention to the specific EPA and DHA values on the label.

Ethyl Ester (EE) Form (Less Ideal): While not inherently ""bad,"" ethyl ester forms are less readily absorbed than triglyceride forms. If you choose an EE supplement, consider taking it with a meal containing fat to improve absorption.

Unclear Sourcing/Lack of Testing: Avoid supplements from brands that don't disclose their sourcing or don't perform third-party testing.

Men vs. women: Both men and women benefit from omega-3s. Women may find them particularly helpful during perimenopause to address inflammation and mood changes.

• Iron:

Ideal daily dose: This varies significantly based on individual needs and iron status. General recommendations for adults are around 8mg for men and 18mg for pre-menopausal women. However, active women, those with heavy menstrual bleeding, or those diagnosed with iron deficiency may need significantly higher doses.

Enhancing Absorption: Vitamin C significantly enhances non-heme iron absorption (found in plant-based foods). Consuming iron-rich foods with vitamin C-rich foods (citrus fruits, bell peppers) can improve iron intake.

Inhibiting Absorption: Certain substances can inhibit iron absorption, including calcium, tannins (found in tea and coffee), and phytates (found in grains and legumes). It's best to avoid consuming these substances with iron-rich foods or supplements.

Best form: Carbonyl or glycinate iron are highly bioavailable and well-tolerated forms.

Worst form: Ferrous sulfate is a common but less bioavailable form and may cause gastrointestinal issues.

Men vs. women: Women generally have higher iron needs than men due to menstruation. Active women and those with heavy menstrual bleeding may require even more iron.

Additional points about Omega 3, Iron, and Creatine:

Omega 6: A high intake of omega-6 fatty acids (found in many processed foods and vegetable oils) can compete with omega-3s for absorption and utilization. Balancing omega-6 intake is important for maximizing the benefits of omega-3 supplementation.

Iron Testing: It's essential to get your iron levels checked by a doctor before starting iron supplementation. Iron overload can be harmful.

Creating Loading: A loading phase is not strictly necessary. Taking the maintenance dose of 3-5 grams per day will still saturate your muscle stores, but it will take about 3-4 weeks to achieve the same level of saturation as with a loading phase.

I stumble over again and again that women eat to little (undereat) more often.

The mind is stronger than what the feeding cravings and nutritional signals that the physical body tells our brain.😢

Fun to learn the difference between hiw much women and male in % time of sitting (inactivity). 😂

As a Jodo trainer it is good to learn how women differs and what they need to emphasis in their training. 👍 (I know the difference but not what exercises that I need to use in my program.)

Cut right back on cardio, do strength training - I do power yoga twice a week & lift heavy twice a week and then long walks sometimes with a weighted vest 4 to 5x a week (but not super heavy weight). I eat animal based every meal, I no longer do any prolonged fasts just eat 3X a day clean and animal based with l o animal fat & fermented veggies, no snacking, no alcohol, v minimal sugar. Go to bed early, stay cool, get rid of chemicals/toxins. Get rid of toxic people & stressful work. Love yourself & find joy in the small things. Good luck

Edit - meant to say week before period cut right back on heavy weights, more walks, gentler yoga & during period play it by ear as some months you’ll have more energy than others.",@sunmoonstars3879,UC-UNiGXeFPm4QXbIjvQpx5Q,23,2025-01-06T18:53:53Z,False,True,Ugz2XpRly8BNr42qebt4AaABAg

I wish that Dr Simms and Dr Pelz could resolve this, both influential in this space and both saying entirely opposite things and it’s so confusing. In a podcast I watched between both, it appeared that Dr Mindy conceded Dr Simm’s that women should not train fasted. 

Yet in an interview on this very podcast - Dr Mindy repeated that exercising fasted is beneficial for women (she even has a short of it on her FB page) so I’m leaning more towards Dr Mindy Pelz giving out contradictory messaging around this but she is emphatic on the benefits of fasted training for women where Dr Simms isn’t. 

They’re both highly influential in this space and it’s not easy for the layman to work out what to believe.

Fasting experts say that in the absence of glucose (for women too) the body will burn ketones and so we’ll lose weight? Dr Simms isn’t saying the body will burn ketones but will favor lean muscle. Doesn’t this debunk Ketogenic diets altogether? How does a women lose weight then if we can’t burn fat - doesn’t make sense - that would mean we’d only lose all muscle and never weight. Heavens - this is frustratingly confusing. I am so happy though that the focus on women and menopause is here and I value it - I just wish the messages weren’t so contradictory so we could get a fairly consistent message.

I'm saying this to be kind as I care for someone with a health issue, and I myself know what its like to have a self limiting belief. Its not all or nothing, you dont need a personal trainer, most of them don't know how to adapt to different abilities, you can be healthy in so many ways, even if you can't do intense Excercise, some of the things ive listed above are so easy for someone even in your condition.

Girls are constantly critiqued on how their body is changing, boys start calling attention to their chests, girls are reminded to be ""ladylike"". So this self awareness comes from the environment, it is very much a nurture thing. 

To push the narrative boys don't develop self awareness of their bodies and behaviour highly discredits boys and is insulting to their intelligence as well as sense of self. They do notice their bodies changing. They do notice girls being uncomfortable with unwanted advances. They do notice how certain uncomfortable aspects of puberty reduce their chances. They do notice their behaviour can be sometimes downright illegal if they were adults. They are socialsed to believe they'll get away with it and the world is their oyster.
