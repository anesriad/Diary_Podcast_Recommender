It takes weeks and weeks to physically recovery from childbirth just to have some semblence of normalcy and resume regular biological function. Birth rates going down and women not getting married is beneficial to women plus this conversation also demostrates multiple examples of just how non-committal, self-involved and lazy the male species is when it comes to partners and families. Rates are decreasing in industrial countries because they correlate with countries where women have legal rights over their bodies (they may not be enforced but we have them).

Studies indicate that after age 40, sperm motility and morphology can decline, and DNA fragmentation in sperm may increase, potentially affecting fertility and increasing risks of miscarriage or genetic issues in offspring. Testosterone levels also gradually decrease, which can impact libido and sexual function, indirectly affecting fertility. Despite this, many men in their 60s and beyond can still father children, though success rates may be lower compared to younger men. Lifestyle factors, health conditions, and genetics play significant roles.

The fact that so many ppl would rather do their own thing, tells us that those characteristic have probably always been there and all the human contact we had before was great for reproduction and survival and not because all of us enjoyed it. Back then we just didnt have the luxury of doing our own thing.

There are sooooo many other reasons why humans are possibly less happy now, and i dont think he's taking that into consideration.

When he said  that ppl saying things like "" you should go out, it will make you happy"" means it must have been true at one point, he lost me. No, that's really only true for ppl that like being around other ppl.

I think his view of this being an evolutionary thing doesnt make sense. 

Contact and being less selfish is good to continue the human race, and while he may be right, his examples do little to prove that we were happier humans when we had to be around each other a lot more.",@anaaguilar3304,UCWsd48ACGDOHmIEx9KT8oEw,0,2025-07-15T20:19:33Z,False,False,

And yet Bill goes on and on about connection being the most important thing in life. But what about kids? Don't they get to connect? Supposing his partner was taken away and substituted with a robot? I bet he wouldn't like that... and yet he's happy to subject children to such alienation. Except for them it will be far far worse, because it will affect them developmentally. He could always start having intimate relationships with humans again. But kids brought up by robots won't have that choice... they will be too developmentally impaired. Already we have an epidemic of ADHD and autism.... with robots substituting parents a significant amount of the time, this will get much worse.

Here's my hypothesis:

Exercise increases blood flow throughout the body.  The heart beats faster, blood vessels dilate, the heat produced by metabolism elevates body temperature.  After exercise, the mitochondria are replenishing ATP stores, and calling for increased oxygen.  These are all reasons that exercise increases tissue perfusion both during and immediately after exercise.

Long-term, exercise promotes the growth of additional capillaries, leading to long-term increasee perfusion if tissues, especially skeletal muscles and cardiopulmonary tissues, but also liver and kidneys, and probably every tissue.

The result of the increased perfusion is that whatever you ingest, whether it is nutritious, poisonous, or nilpotent, reaches a greater fraction of the cells of your body.  The muscles in the back of your neck get more pickled from the alcohol you drank.  Your pancreas absorbs more of the CoQ10 that you took before your workout, etc.  

I think that simple mechanism is probably powerful enough to mask whatever more nuanced effects might be at play.

This is my opinion as someone who has exercised for long periods of time, and also who has not exercised at all for even longer periods of time.  When you are in the habit of exercising, your whole body feels more integrated.  When you are out of shape, you acquire more injuries that are localized.  E.g. my right knee is stiff when I wake up in the mornings, but my left knee is OK.  If I started an exercise routine, it would inherently correct that complaint (probably), but I would also stop having new complaints that are so isolated to one joint, one appendage, one organ.  I believe this because this is how it feels to me to be in my body.  Being in shape integrates wll the parts of the body simply by perfusing them all more thoroughly than being a lump does.",@HeathHunnicutt,UCUauCNPNLr-H8ePBTX9d7AQ,0,2025-06-09T20:04:33Z,False,False,

In the late 80’s 90’s I was single . I’m attractive but I’m funny & kind . I lived inNYc and literally always working. I decided every day for1/2 hr to go somewhere different even a bar sit at the end of the bar - go to a different gym and do community work and took a chance going to parties- go for 20 min and leave. 
That’s how I met my husband. A blind date at a party. Only The blind date I kinda  got lost on and met my now husband . Married 33 years & kids from 35-40. 
 My advice, find your gifts, be the best version of yourself man or woman & not just sex  pleasure but the bigger picture - Get out of your chair, computer , phone and meet and greet. It’s not going to come to you. Be prepared to be rejected & be kind & respectful .

Cheating or competitive reproduction for monkeys and big testicles doesn’t equal humans should be that way too, the difference between humans and monkeys regardless of human males having the similarity of large testicles is that humans also have very large and highly developed brains. 3x that of a chimpanzee. Monogamy, Polyamory, or cheating are choices that a human gets to make and each have their own evolutionary advantages. There’s a reason nature creates diversity. I’m not exactly sure how angry or upset a female or male chimpanzee would get to find out their partner cheated on them but if you’re willing to hurt your human partner for the risk of an STD that you may pass on to them too, for quick satisfaction, or to prove that you’re still attractive to others well that’s your choice. You make a choice and you reap the benefits and the consequences. It’s not easy being monogamous if that’s your mindset. It’s very easy to be monogamous and to be loyal if you choose everyday to love your partner’s flaws, work to improve each other and to love all the best parts of them too.

Robot nannys can help support parents for sure, we live in a world where we desperately need support and have turned away from community based raising. As long as a child feels loved by their family (robot included) which and you will see children grow love for their robot nannys. If you take away that robot nanny when it’s no longer fundamental then you will see a whole rise of child detachment issues in kids if the parents have failed to form close bonds with the child. Nature can hurt and sometimes nature calls for a robot to raise children in the future and that robot may die, malfunction or be shut down. We will have to deal with those consequences as best we can and it’s better to start considering preemptive measures now because it’s probably inevitably going to happen.

They say they don't want to be single but can't find a mate. It's like the desire of women who want a partner or family is on the decline and that's very concerning especially as a single father of a 19yo boy. My mom left my dad when I was 7 my son's mom left after 5yrs together and I haven't dated since. Not because I don't want to I'm just no longer desired I guess. I'm invisible on dating apps. I also noticed dating profiles now often say men must be college educated and have a job. As a retired man who never went to college that rules me out at age 52. Many also say must not support Trump or be Republican! I'm worried girls are attracted to narracist men often when young and finally give up on dating around age 30 to 40 but had they given other men they were not initially attracted to the non narracists I suspect they wouldn't just give up after yrs of failed relationships. I find the older I get the harder it is but dad always said as I got older and wealthy the women would come. It's been the exact opposite for me. I had girlfriends when younger however I will admit they were usually long term as in yrs but I always thought that was a good sign. The loneliness is a problem and it also worsens as we age. Wealth has not made me happy but my past relationships with girls usually did. All I had ever wanted was a family finally got one and 5yrs later she leaves without explanation! We have to do better. We have to learn to love others not just ourselves. Isolation isn't the answer it may work for some for a few yrs but usually it's a problem eventually. God literally created women from mans ribs so he wouldn't be lonely as to have children yet here we are with more single men than ever before. We're not even having enough kids to replace the current population.🙏,@vapeking466,UCti2beGEmsNIFYWBZAiZYkQ,1,2025-05-08T10:09:52Z,False,True,UgyO4K39osx8FESQ14x4AaABAg

I've been single since my son's mother left me over a decade ago out of the blue. She never explained why but I am pretty sure her best friend set her up with some male friend of hers on a girls night out just two weeks before the split. All I want is something real yet I get no replies on dating apps as if wealthy retired men at 52 are non desirable. I find it concerning very concerning especially as a single father of a 19yo son. I do pay for his college but even that is no promise for a mans future especially today. We have tons of men who went to college yet never found a job related. I believe the biggest issue the majority especially youth don't get is the division between men and women is all by design brought by the elite to reduce the population and destroy the family.

OMG they desperately seek to try and figure out what is going on with them and why they are the way they are + we've seen it and suspected based on what we learned over the last year in your video. Brought it all together perfectly. The individual does not want to be how they are. They don't understand why they are the way they are and not a single therapist has been able to successfully grasp an inch of what's going on and always dismisses and has their own therapeutic agenda. Seems like if the individual watch this and really listened they would go aha. That's why I'm the way I am. But you see as the cocktail of attachment styles will prevent the individual from even watching this.... The struggle is coming to a very scary boiling point and everyone knows the culprit that damaged the individual so badly.  I never saw someone try to learn about themselves and resolve trauma to make their lives worth living. As much as I have this person and as people who love them, it's driving us crazy because the one therapist that was making headway moved and it's been a downward spiral ever since.  They don't want to be the way they are. They know the way they are is wrong but they don't know how to fix it and handle healing to become the person they want to be. It's funny they will spend time with the therapist. They don't even like and tolerate them until they fire them and move on to the next but won't spend an hour with the people who love them to try and help with information like this.

He also was off base with something he just said about men going around committing crimes are the ones without partners.
That's not true. They're probably only eclipse by famous men in the likeliness to have somebody. And women being drawn to men who show a propensity for violence has been proven by many studies.
And is reflected in the many love letters in jail  that men receive that commit crimes of notoriety.

This might be selfish, but it's true.

 I think many are prone to accidentally hooking up with narcissists, psychopaths, and other people with serious mental health issues that can endanger your own mental health and give you Stockholm Syndrome. Many of us want to avoid that now, and are therefore choosing to live alone.

 I think a lot of people are prone to getting into ""situationships"" instead of real relationships based on love and mutual interest. Those who want to be wise are choosing to remain single until the right person comes along. Until then, we're content with being single. Better to live alone than with someone who constantly nags, wrecks the car or gambles.

Many of us are scared to fall in love and maybe get pregnant with the wrong person and have children in a world that expects us to raise the children according to what society wants instead of what's right for the family. The parents will likely get mired in inescapable credit card debt for the children. It is a recipe for toxic stress that most of us can't bear to even imagine, let alone actually live it. We have dreams and hobbies and aspirations we don't want to sacrifice for another person/people with whom we must live. Such a sacrifice leads to bitterness and resentment. 

I often wonder if economic hardship mixed with toxic family relationships is a big contributor to suicidal depression/anxiety. That seems pretty plausible to me.",@thecommoncaveat,UCS1haeYeN3WACyJrA_iZ8dQ,0,2025-04-07T03:44:58Z,False,False,

Yes gratitude makes tou happy when you get it that your happiness doesn't only depend on your ego taking care of you, but that life supports you when you are eager to look at it that way.

Very rural places tend to have people who are just alike living next to each other, despite an increased distance between individual households.
There's also much less activities for people to do. Many rural places social life centers around things like high school sports.
And similar to the tribe that he mentioned, expectations and aspirations are much lower. In the harshest places to live, not letting a small cut turn into a life threatening infection is a big deal.
So rural places may have a closer relationship with the people next door, but city people are more likely to engage in more varied activities and form close relationships where they meet at places.

The issue with poor people and rich people is simple as well. Misery loves company, humans are happier when they see others suffer like them.

I think Dr Von Hippel doesn’t make enough of a distinction between evolutionary motivated behaviors and socially motivated behaviors, especially when making a parallel between Hunter-Gatherers and Modern Humans.

Like, what are attractive qualities for a man? Depends entirely on the type of society that man lives in, when talking about Modern Man — what is socially acceptable, what is legal, what moral, what is desirable, etc. are all important variables that do not apply when referring to hunter-gatherers. Or at the very least, not in the same way Western society views these concepts today.

Our modern society has long plateaued as far as genetic mutations in the context of evolution and all it entails as a process. Modern humans have surpassed a lot of the biological imperatives that hunter-gatherers could not, because the type of society they operated in and what that meant for gene propagation. Even they consciously could have, they would have gone extinct.

We have the luxury of being able to override our evolutionarily ‘driven’ genes. 

What I mean to say with all my (probably) nonsense is that this whole idea of ‘risk taker’, ‘high testosterone’ and ‘nice guy’ is both reductive of our ability as a species to think for ourselves - and not our genitals - but also bypasses the simple concepts that sway us in most of our decision making, such as personal taste or preferred esthetics.

Dr Von Hippel, goes back and forth between ‘evolutionary qualities’ and modern preferences. He’s asked about evolutionary ideals and he talks about hips to waist ratio on Playboy Bunnies, then turns around and says that masculinity is directly correlated to testosterone. At times, he’s worryingly close to sounding like Red Pill Bro with a degree. Those are dangerous idea to be spreading under the guise of science, especially when it’s unclear whether he’s talking about a primeval gene propagating imperative or modern society’s genetic ideals. He’s giving simplistic notions on gender and sex a place that it should not have in a science based society, in 2025.",@educationaltoe,UCDPKsewwu8p0uyFzAlCavyw,2,2025-03-21T01:57:18Z,False,False,

1) I DON'T believe robot nannies would reduce the incidence of parents abusing their kids. They may neglect them less but in terms of physical and sexual abuse - those things don't happen because parenting is hard work  - they happen because some parents are spiteful, selfish people who take out their frustrations with their status in life on their kids. The additional disconnect from other people that might come from parenting groups / family they interact with for babysitting etc would give them more autonomous time to stew / ruminate and become angrier. Most kids are abused by their primary care givers or the intimate partner of their primary care givers unfortunately. Abusive parents should get away with it less / for less time if the child has a broader network / community they can trust that actually cares. People who can rely on robots can isolate their kids which encourages MORE abuse. I hope we NEVER have robot nannies!

2) If homosexuality is a complex genetic trait - and we know that it exists on a spectrum in both men and women it's not about men being cleaner if they have homosexual genes. I would say men who are less dependant on women for sexual gratification and less needy for it + less able to get some sensual fulfillment (even if it's NOT actually sex) from contact with other people are less likely to become so frustrated / territorial with the women close to them that they murder them. Also less likely to be similarly sexually aggressive to female offspring and therefore their female offspring are not going to risk leaving their community for a smaller one with less chance for survival. Hence their genes are more likely to be passed on to a larger number of grandkids etc. His theory doesn't explain homosexuality in women. A woman who is less sexually jealous of her man is less likely to be nasty to other women he's been with or children he has by other women - makes for a more cohesive tribal environment where everyone is helping everyone to survive.

3) He says people who have happy marriages are just happy people before marriage and therefore stay married even if it's no better. However, by his own reasoning if being happy makes them more willing to make things work and try to work things out then it's the combination of two of these personality types that DOES make the relationship BETTER. The marriage IS better because they're not moping or fighting all the time. Maybe they don't earn more money etc. It's still BETTER.",@sharlah4057,UC34ExZbVWba15lJhtzqA58Q,0,2025-03-11T12:27:58Z,False,False,

If you've used any ai at all you would understand that ai is programmed to be way more empathetic than most humans. It makes perfect sense to have ai bots train our children in all human knowledge. 

We have barely scratched the surface of human potential. Imagine using an information bot to train all children using all human knowledge base then have them use facial cues and questions to make sure the information has been assimilated. Then map the child's biorhythms and scan their brains to know what they need based on their actions before they even understand what's happening. 

The idea of using ai bots to train humans is phenomenal. We are at the precipus  of a new humanity that's light years ahead of us now, in the next hundred years.

I currently live out of a backpack and travel all around the world. There are times when I sleep at the beach and honestly, those are the times that I have the best sleep and wake up feeling the happiest. 

I view modern day society as being a cage, we have been domesticated and tranquilized with drugs, alcohol, technology, food, shopping, etc. We are now reliant on corporations to give us what we want and need. I believe the reason why people that live in huts are happier than people that live in the western world is because they rely solely on the earth. They don’t try to change things. They accept the earth as it is. They don’t overindulge. 

It’s all about acceptance whereas in modern society if we don’t find something acceptable, we try to change it, typically creating products.  I want to be solely reliant on the Earth. Our downfall was when we started farming and stopped depending on the Earth. We had enough but man always wants more and that is the problem. 

HUMANS created addiction, depression and anxiety through the life we live today. If we weren’t born with it, we don’t need it. Period.

💡 Here are my top 3 takeaways:
#1 We’re wired for the past, living in the present – A lot of our struggles (relationships, attraction, happiness) come from mismatches between our biology and modern life.
#2 Attraction isn’t just looks—it’s survival – What we find attractive has changed over time based on what was seen as valuable for survival and reproduction.
#3 Understanding yourself is power – When you know why you think and act the way you do, you can make better choices instead of just reacting to instincts.

So here’s my question back:
What’s one belief about attraction or success that changed for you over time? Drop it below 👇

Humans are never satisfied via evolution. Truly existence is a hamster wheel. Soon there will be no legacies because there will be no one to remember. Runaway climate change alone can end the humans before this century is out given what is already baked in, without another molecule of GHG's emissions. Thing is that runaway climate change is not the only Overshoot predicament. The more humans continue on with their cancerous techno industrial civilization the quicker they bring on the pain. We are already at a stage where we can no longer prevent our towns and cities from burning and the negative consequences/wounds to our industrial agriculture system are mounting - not talking about predicaments does not make them go away. Problems can be solved. Predicaments have outcomes. Obviously we did not curb emissions of change our behaviour in the slighest since the first serious warning in 1988 (Pop 5,141,992,542). What we did instead was go in the opposite direction - Globalization. The single biggest economic boom, founded on consumerism, in human history, and it's still growing (Pop today  8,208,762,977). Not only have we refused to change (incapable IMO), but we are not even taking any precautions to protect our homes, businesses and critical infrastructure from the next record Smashing, global warming Jacked disaster. Trump and crew's response is classic denial - redact any and all mentions of the word climate change from the entire federal government - like that will reverse the laws of physics and chemistry. There's a sub group of people who are collapse watchers, called accelerationists who want US collapse to happen  ASAP and they love Trump and cheered when he was elected because they believe he will accelerate the US empire and home nation's collapse. I tend to agree with them on this one. Classic, end-stage desperate behaviour of trying to FORCE the world and nation and people to change and bring about his twisted MAGA utopia.

In our days, still in some countries and cultures it is believed that, women has to do the house chores, and nothing else. And on the other hand there exists, those who are just putting women under pressure. Like a women must follow these these and these before she can become a mother. Society is expecting people to get the things done- like you 1st have to finish college, a good one, not a simple, than a Master or even better Phd and then find a job secure and then maybe. Because, indeed governments do not offer a special good programs incl. financial ones to support more the new mums and dads. And that s painful. Instead of thinking about brining technology to take care of the children, we have to do realistic moves - like higher the financial aid, and focus on education.

Personally, I don’t feel happy being surrounded by people I have nothing in common with, especially if I find them unintelligent.  

I was born and raised in a provincial town in Italy during the '90s and 2000s, and I always felt out of place. As a child, it was fine, but as I grew up, I started to feel surrounded by people who didn’t understand me, sometimes even by people I found quite stupid with narrow minds.  

Now, I have a few close friends, and while I know some of my neighbors and enjoy casual conversations with them, these relationships never turn into true friendships (also because some of them are 20-30 years older than me). Would I really be happier if I lived in the countryside and had more superficial relationships like this? I don’t think so.  

I believe that no matter where we live, there are only a few people who truly resonate with us, and that unhappiness often comes from internal struggles rather than external circumstances. I feel content with my small circle of friends and spending time at home with my hobbies.",@silvia.sala.photography,UCQfLXPG0H1K401hNoPmo2-Q,1,2025-02-27T11:36:05Z,False,False,

It’s the constraints of patriarchy that drive women to seek security through someone like Bill Gates; not necessarily biological attraction. In fact, it’s been proven that most women will seek a high testosterone man to mate with around ovulation; not a rich old guy or nerd. Given testosterone decreases in a man’s thirties, this means that women, too, are most biologically attracted to a younger man. The truth is, by and large, men have been afforded the luxury of acting upon biological urges while women have had to suppress them out of fear. Now that women are freeing themselves from the constraints of patriarchy, they, too, will be afforded that luxury, and we’ll soon see a very different picture. In the meantime, if one were to simply study matriarchal societies where women are born with the ongoing support and security of their families throughout their lives, who a woman is attracted to will not likely include an old man with money. (Btw, it’s much, much harder for a man to have children, especially healthy children, as he ages, too. Maybe not as difficult as it is for a woman,  but he’s certainly not at his peak, and therefore, not a fertile woman’s first choice.)

If you're too much of a ""man's man,"" you might only focus on discipline and survival, without emotional awareness. That lack of emotional connection makes it harder to communicate, cooperate, and engage with women on a deeper level. You might struggle to push their buttons in the right way or navigate relationships effectively.

I get it because, in some ways, I guess I have a few ""gay traits"" in the sense that I'm very in touch with my emotions. But I'm definitely straight—I prefer women and could never see myself otherwise. Maybe it’s how I was raised or just how I developed, but I can completely relate to this idea.
 also been raised around women. I didn't have a father but my father came back in my life when I was in high school. So I have an understanding also from just trial and error

The reason I can be confident in my relationship is that I've been with my wife for most of my life (we had on and off moments in the past. I've been with other women before) . I'm 24 years old, and we've been together since middle school. She loves me deeply, and we have an amazing connection, both emotionally and physically. I always make sure she’s satisfied before I am because I see it as a reset button—it strengthens our bond.

I understand women, not just from being with my wife but also from experience. I've seen how some women try to be manipulative, and I know what they want. I was raised around women since my father wasn’t in my life growing up, though he came back when I was in high school. Through that, and my own trial and error, I’ve developed a strong understanding of relationships and how to navigate them.",@Indoekneejah,UCt-hHBFsdE15kr5MmCs9uyQ,0,2025-02-25T15:39:31Z,False,False,

Out of all theses episodes I’ve watched, this is the one I found to be more of an opinion instead of fact. This doctor is spreading false information based on his opinion and not facts. There’s been a wide steady to see if people possess a gay gene and there has not been any solid determination that there is. And this doctor BILL is making claims that there are gay genes.

Dr. Bill Von Hippel’s claim that “there’s a gay gene” and that its expression determines whether someone is homosexual, heterosexual, or metrosexual is a BOLD statement, but it is not widely supported by genetic research.

What Does the Science Say?
	1.	No Single “Gay Gene” Exists – Large-scale genetic studies, such as the 2019 genome-wide association study (GWAS) published in Science, analyzed data from nearly half a million people and found that no single gene determines sexual orientation. Instead, they identified multiple genetic markers that may contribute in small ways.
	2.	Genetics Is Only One Factor – Sexual orientation appears to be influenced by a complex mix of genetic, hormonal, environmental, and social factors. While genetics may contribute, it does not function as a strict determinant.
	3.	No Evidence of a “Gay Gene in Everyone” – There is no mainstream genetic research supporting the idea that everyone has a universal “gay gene” that simply varies in expression. The GWAS study did find some genetic variants associated with same-sex attraction, but they were not universal, and their effects were small.

Evaluating the Claim

If Dr. Von Hippel’s statement were true, we would expect to see strong genetic correlations in twin studies, where identical twins (who share the same DNA) would always share the same orientation. However, studies show that while identical twins are more likely to have the same orientation than non-identical twins, they do not always match, suggesting non-genetic influences play a role.

Conclusion

While genetics plays a role in sexual orientation, the claim that everyone has a “gay gene” that determines different levels of sexuality does not align with current scientific evidence.",@RaylinFrancois,UCoxWUAVczD1kFpQIWu47aLA,0,2025-02-23T15:59:32Z,False,False,

Not all, but there are a lot of women who want to have children. Some of them also really love being intimate. Some have no interest whatsoever. So I think it's not accurate to say humans haven't evolved to want to reproduce.

I also know a lot of women who would have loved and cherished every moment of looking after their young children. But we live in economic systems that require the average couple to both be working. Perhaps they would have appreciated a robot nanny to change nappies at 3am or clean up the food thrown against the walls.

1.) To me it's obvious that people in rural areas are more ""happy"" than urban dwellers & I think a huge factor that was not spoken about in this conversation is that in rural areas, humans live much closer to nature, to their natural rhythms, to the land & have access to forests, fields, the full expanse of the sky every day, etc. Not to mention a quiet, peaceful environment. This alone causes us to sleep better and generally enhances health, which directly influences how we ""feel"" each day. In a city (and I've lived in DC and NY for multiple years) - there is never quiet, there is high stimulation and very low access to the natural world, and what there is is often an afterthought, and still not the same peace, quiet and truly wild energy of rural areas. Being close to the natural world enhances happiness. 

2.) There are also a lot of us (neurodivergent - I'm an HSP) who actually find community quite grating and exhausting to navigate. I have lived in various intentional-community like settings and ended up super burnt out by them. We had meals together, recreation & working together, etc with very little time to be autonomous. I felt like I lost my essence and at the same time utterly burntout by the constant stimulation & people-ing. Then a few years after working as a teacher and normal 9-5 jobs in non profits (with decent community-like staff), left those. I have never been happier or more at peace living on my own and working from home. I found my boyfriend of 2+ years at a group salsa class (which is great for introverts b/c you rarely have to talk, you just learn the dance steps together) and I need him and my 2 close girlfriends. I have never been someone who needs large friend groups - in fact, that would exhaust me. I am plenty happy with my small circle, the natural world, pets and silence. I think I am not alone in this! Like, yes to fostering enriching relationships in this every independent world, but I also think it has to be done according to one's temperament & nervous system bandwidth. 

3.) I'd love to see an interview with someone (or various) who are child free by choice, not because it's too expensive or they cannot conceive, etc. I enjoy the guests who speak to sex/relationships/hormones, etc. always, but it does often seem like ""having kids"" is the positive thing and expected of everyone, and if you can't or don't want kids, that is the lesser choice. When in fact many of us who are plenty fertile and would actually do a good job at maternal/paternal roles just don't have that desire and never have. And we consider our calling in this lifetime to be divergent from that norm, although I think it's becoming more common. People don't just opt out of having kids b/c it's expensive or the world ""is dangerous"" - many of us simply have zero desire to be a parent, it seems utterly exhausting and would take away from the lifestyle we prefer and the work we feel called to do in the world.",@kellysuefitz,UCt2PLec5Y1Wxw1WLU0U4Vzg,0,2025-02-21T13:27:23Z,False,False,

Eternal male fertility is a myth it's simply not true. It's all downhill for men after 40.Dr Guy Morris, “Stories of celebrity men fathering children into their 60s may give a skewed perspective on the potential risks.”
“From the age of 30, your testosterone naturally starts to reduce as well, and then other lifestyle factors start to impact. So actually, while the potential is still there, in reality men become less fertile simply as they age. So it’s a really, really bad idea, if you have a known medical problem, to think you can put it off until you’re 40.” “By highlighting a 70-something celebrity saying ‘Look! I’ve had my 17th kid with my wife, who’s 25,’ is not going to apply to 90 per cent of the population, because most men’s fertility declines after 40.”",@Legendaricon,UCrLg_aHJjgpwHyYNdduc48A,0,2025-02-21T02:47:38Z,False,False,

If you read the DSM different editions over the years, you can easily see how now, virtually anyone can be diagnosed as being 'on the spectrum'. I'm a nurse who works in emergency care. One night, it wasn't busy at all, and we sat around talking with the psychologists who were on call. Sure enough, every one of us could be considered autistic by the latest criteria. They did say, that no competent person who had the legal power to hand down this diagnosis would ever use it to classify someone who didn't actually have the difficulties that come with being autistic, but like anything else, there will always be some who would. And so, we now have an ever expanding population of people with minor social difficulties that are being medicated for a condition which they don't actually have. All because by carrying this diagnosis, they are no longer held responsible for themselves, everyone else is.",@d.e.b.b5788,UC_IcF1KVtLARJ2QleTYQWJg,0,2025-02-20T21:03:15Z,False,False,

This is not accurate and feeds wrong ideas to people, Womens worth being a lot around looks has to do with the story of the patriarchy .When women did not study and work, the only thing that was really important for society to survive was their beauty. Now it does not work that way. That is why men today care about a lot more other things other than looks in comparison to BEFORE. But there is still some influence of that way of living from before. Also, male habits have a really big impact on offspring - if the man doesnt work out and eats badly, the likelyhood of the kid dying before being born, or having developmental issues goes upby  a LOT. I am so sick of this false story people perpetuate, its not biological, its also  CULTURAL. Women do care about looks and men also care about intellectual intelligence, emotional intelligence, etc. The smarter someone is the less they care about looks. And the more they like a modern way of gender roles, where there is equality, the less men care about looks and the more women do... Do you think that is a coincidence?

We less appreciate something because our norm level is much higher than the one of a tribe member. Because  little positive things like a nice weather is much more appreciated when you were really cold/hot and you know the struggles of living in an extreme weather. It's because when you've known war, it's much easier to appreciate peace. The bottom extreme of the emotional scale is so much lower when you live in poverty. But there is only that much of the extremes that the humans can bear. Eventually, the top part of that scale will also be significantly lower, thus easier to achieve. And therefore, for the urbanized rich society, the conditions of achieving happiness are significantly higher, because the low is significantly higher. Moreover, I think romanticizing communal societies neglects the fact of how much a personal opinion of aquestionnair respondent is honest or just society acceptable. The punishment for the ""wrong"" answer is much higher in communal societies.

Dr. Bill Von Hippel""**

Dr. Bill Von Hippel, a distinguished evolutionary psychologist, offers a captivating exploration of how our ancestral instincts influence modern human behavior, happiness, and societal trends. In a wide-ranging conversation, he examines topics from declining fertility rates to the effects of technology on relationships, weaving together evolutionary psychology with practical insights for navigating contemporary life. Below are the key insights distilled from this discussion, culminating in a conclusion that ties these threads together.

------

1. **Declining Fertility Rates and the Rise of Individualism**

- **Insight:** Fertility rates are dropping worldwide, with many industrialized nations seeing reproductive rates below the 2.1 children per woman needed to sustain populations. By 2100, some countries may halve in size. Marriage rates are also declining, and solo living has surged—1 in 7 Americans now live alone, up from 1 in 100 in 1850.
- **Significance:** These shifts signal a move toward individualism, where personal autonomy often trumps communal bonds. Von Hippel suggests that modern life's challenges—like the perceived difficulty of raising children—discourage reproduction, despite our evolutionary drive for sex rather than a direct desire for offspring. This disconnect, amplified by birth control, separates sexual activity from its reproductive outcomes.

------

2. **The Happiness Paradox: Wealth vs. Well-Being**

- **Insight:** Despite significant gains in wealth and living standards since the 1940s, happiness levels in the U.S. and similar nations remain flat. Rural dwellers, though less affluent (25% poorer than urbanites), report higher happiness due to stronger social ties, while city life fosters isolation amid crowds.
- **Significance:** Von Hippel highlights a paradox: material progress doesn’t guarantee emotional fulfillment. Urban environments prioritize autonomy—freedom to pursue individual goals—but this often erodes the social connections essential for happiness. The Hadza tribe, a hunter-gatherer group in Tanzania with over 90% reporting happiness, exemplifies how interdependence outweighs autonomy in fostering well-being.

------

3. **Evolutionary Attraction: Honest Signals of Quality**

- **Insight:** Attraction stems from evolutionary cues of fitness. For men, traits like risk-taking, humor, and ambition signal genetic quality and capability—hard-to-fake ""honest signals."" For women, physical markers like the hip-to-waist ratio correlate with fertility, with fat distribution (e.g., on thighs and buttocks) aiding fetal brain development.
- **Significance:** These instincts persist in modern dating. Men’s risk-taking (linked to high testosterone) attracts partners, though it subsides post-pairing to prioritize family stability. Women’s fertility signals remain consistent across cultures, explaining why certain body shapes endure as attractiveness standards, even as social preferences evolve.

------

4. **Technology’s Double-Edged Sword**

- **Insight:** Dating apps and pornography reshape social and sexual dynamics. Tinder amplifies competition (20% of men get 80% of swipes), while pornography—a recent phenomenon—offers a surrogate for real intimacy, reducing sexual activity among young people (down from 80% to 60-70% between 2006 and 2012 among 18-25-year-olds).
- **Significance:** Technology exploits evolutionary reward systems but often leaves us unfulfilled. Dating apps favor superficial traits, sidelining deeper qualities like kindness, while pornography’s accessibility (tripled in consumption over the same period) may deter real-world connection, contributing to isolation and declining fertility.

------

5. Neurodivergence as an Evolutionary Asset

- **Insight:** Conditions like ADHD and autism may have fueled human innovation. In ancestral settings, neurodivergent traits—unconstrained by social norms—likely drove inventions, with ADHD’s high energy suiting dynamic hunter-gatherer tasks rather than modern monotony.
- **Significance:** Today’s structured environments amplify these conditions’ challenges, yet their historical value suggests a need for adaptive settings that harness diverse thinking. Von Hippel posits that neurodivergence, possibly exacerbated by modern toxins, remains a key to creativity and progress.

------

6. **Religion, Meaning, and Happiness**

- **Insight:** Religious participation boosts happiness, doubling it among regular attendees, not due to doctrine but through community and purpose. Even non-religious prayer enhances well-being, reflecting a universal need for meaning—what Von Hippel calls a ""god-shaped hole.""
- **Significance:** Humans crave purpose, and religion fulfills this by fostering connection and structure. Wealthy individuals, often socially isolated, gain more from religious socializing than poorer, interdependent communities, underscoring the link between meaning, connection, and mental health.

------

7. **Power and Social Dynamics**

- **Insight:** Human power derives from capabilities and networks, not just physical might. Displays vary culturally—individualistic societies flaunt wealth (e.g., America), while collectivist ones value modesty. True power requires toughness and kindness to build supportive alliances.
- **Significance:** Unlike other species, humans leverage cooperation for dominance, a trait honed over millions of years. Understanding these dynamics—balancing strength with empathy—offers a blueprint for influence in personal and professional spheres.

------

8. **Practical Pathways to Happiness**

- **Insight:** Happiness hinges on prioritizing family, shared experiences, and ""idle"" social time over material wealth. Von Hippel advocates balancing autonomy with connection—e.g., eating together to share stories, a nod to ancestral bonding rituals.
- **Significance:** These actionable steps counter modern isolation. Spending on experiences (not possessions) and fostering interdependence align with our evolutionary needs, offering a roadmap to fulfillment amid autonomy’s allure.

------

**Conclusion**

Dr. Von Hippel’s insights reveal a central tension: our evolutionary past equips us for connection, yet modern life pushes us toward autonomy, often to our detriment. Declining fertility, stagnant happiness despite wealth, and technology’s mixed blessings all stem from this imbalance. By understanding attraction’s roots, neurodivergence’s gifts, and the power of meaning and networks, we can reclaim what we’re wired for—community and purpose. His practical advice—prioritize family, embrace experiences, and reconnect—bridges our ancestral instincts with today’s challenges, urging us to reflect and realign for a happier, more connected future.",@MrQuadcity,UCG9HRS5KUtWshdSyNxWsqRA,0,2025-02-19T12:02:20Z,False,False,

So the alcohol consumption (usually later in the day) causing a bigger negative effect in combination with exercise on that day, just means people are self imposing guilt on themselves (either subconsciously or consciously) because the exercise was already done that day. Whereas using blue light before sleep is basically activity that follows exercise, thus they think better of themselves because they are further doing selfcare activities.
So check if there is data collected from people who go to do exercise at 10pm at night after a night out drinking. See if the said ""effect"" measured is better than exercise before alcohol consumption.",@eglantinew739,UC9rRy3V_Q1Ut0PuPsfQogFg,0,2025-02-19T09:55:19Z,False,False,

Human beings do not have infinite patience and are certainly not so soft or fluffy. The questions that the child asks and the assumptions they acquire as a result of the interactions with the machine, make them less adapted to dealing with mankind. They will be destined to fail from day-one. Machines should aid not replace. Replacing has disastrous consequences.
The idea of alloparenting from the evolutionary standpoint is incorrect. The guardian imparts knowledge of the family, clan and community as well as their skills and protection. The guardian is a par of that society, the machine is not. The machine can give all these without being a part of that society.

Not to blow my own trumpet. I think you should have me on for a normal person who's about to blow something up. 

I've been hammering your podcasts more of late as my children have been sexual abused by their own dad and his family are all in the mason. Long to short he's got access to them and I havnt seen them since the 13th Jan. This year my birthday which was my 31st. The numerology that's present is maaaaaadddd! This is the most awful thing anyone should ever deal with. I've been getting followed by undercover polive and potentially cult with the evidence I've found. This is fucked. But I'm in full believe I'll get them back safe. I've been hammering this and sound healing videos. Eating every day and sleeping. I can't believe how well am doing. The word 'homeostasis' I can't remember the womans name now but that was a game changer. I could do with help getting my girls back and spreading light onto the Situation. They can't keep this in the dark if Steven bangs it on his podcast. Ive got evidence and it's quite scary. Not as scared as my girls will be. I hate it when people say trust me but please, Allow a womans couple of scoops of fucked up delusional sounding story be enough to let you know. I'm sick of this system and I will change it. No mother or child will go through what I am right now. I don't know how am going to do. We'll I do actually have a few ideas. But dealing with the emontions and mental states I'm going through it quite hard to focus on anything other than actually trying to get them home. Court was yesterday. It was on video and I got muted when I tried to take jurisdiction from the judge. I didn't even get to present my evidence and she ignored my special notice and when I challenged it. I got muted. You'd never ever believe what I've done in my life unless you lived it. Until 2023 I could of wrote a book with my mad adventures in ibiza and Manchester abit like kevin and perry. 
I had Felicity in 2021 and Trixie in 2022. Life was bliss with fliss and trixie. I fell out with their dad life was great. My friend died and my great grandad in same week and he came back. From there on lots of strange shit happend. To highlight the trama boom of
2023 I was nearly murdered 2x. Like no joke hammer to the head, strangled off both my feet. 

2024 I took Felicity: age-2, Trixie age-1 and my Mam who's got M.S and dementia, fully on my own to Ibiza for a 2 weeks all inclusive.

Also a a couple of UK holidays just me and the girls. Glasgow. Newcastle. Morcambe. All on the train no car. 

Life was mega, then I discovered this. I'd been doing tarot cards and I saw somthing dark coming. Did I know it was gonna be this? No like fuck did I. I can't believe what going on.  I havnt seen my kids in 5 weeks and I have evidence and the police arnt doing anything? HELP, also love you Steven your passion and tenacity for what you do, and how you do it. You smash joe Rogan, maybe a joint from time to time would be good tho I could do with one for my slot 😉 I really do hope and pray I'll hear from you soon. Take care love Jade from workington. If anyone could offer advice who reads this. Send a sister some light please the lifes doing a Britney bitch on me right now. I'll take any advice. How to stop a corrupted police force who are using my kids for potentially pedophile rings. Or itd just their dad and his family's money and and people up in the masons. I wonder how much it costs to cover up and 3 & 2 year old sex abuse case, but that not my question. My question is, what's it going to take to stop this? Not just for me? But for anyone who's suffers in silence because of police corruption? I'm sorting out taking them to court obviously. But this problem in the systems gone on for too long, and all it would take is heart. Unconditional love. But moneys power and the human ego seem to matter more than my babies lifes? So sad. Talk about putting the jade in Jaded. I'll win. I always do eventually. Maybe see you soon or if not. I bet in 3 years time, I will then. 

All the best, never stop doing what you do. You've saved my mental helsth beyond means. Beautiful man inside and out and also shout Jimmy Carr who's sick humour resonates with my life on a level it shouldn't but that life and I love him mans a inspiration I'll see him in 3 year on live and the apollo well maybe 2.

Happiness is one emotion in a broad range of emotions that humans experience daily.  Trying to stay in a state of happiness is like trying to keep an ice-cream cone from melting on a hot day.  Just eat the icecream when you get it.. savor every bite in the moment, and then recall the memory of the experience often in your mind, recreating the feelings you had days/years after the event. 
If there's one thing people should seek is inner peace. It's when you connect with the true, eternal self that exists under the emotions and ups and downs of human life. It's the self that's there when the mind is not thinking thoughts. It's the self that's there when you release identification with your mind and body. It's the real you, eternal, whole, complete and perfect, regardless of age, circumstance and status. If you can connect with that inner peace, which is your true self, your true nature, then you ride the roller coaster of life and don't cling to any positive emotions or fear any negative ones. Inner peace is what we should be working on discovering and maintaining as human beings, not happiness.",@rachelpham5993,UC9tLlU83uOYt_snJFtbH6Yg,0,2025-02-18T20:26:29Z,False,False,

Generally we only get ""stuff"" to impress women because they care about ""status"".  Women compete with other women over who has the most status.  This leads to women wanting more and more stuff from men.  The reason women are asked to ""settle for less"" is because it creates the society problem we are seeing all over the world in developed countries.  When the effort it takes to get a woman gets too high, men will learn to live without them and revert to minimalist behavior.  AKA the juice isn't worth the squeeze.  

With the modern conveniences of tv and video games for entertainment, access to porn for sexual release, and drugs like alcohol and marijuana to sedate our frustrations; There's not only less motivation than previous generations due to feminism causing women to want more from men since they can make their own money now, there's WAY less motivation since there's now alternatives for men to turn to that don't even require them to leave the house anymore!

Healthy men and women know what they bring to the table and won't expect others to adjust to their parameters, nor will they make major changes to adjust to another's.

It's not about settling for less-than, it's settling for realistic. 
Western culture bases most of its understanding of romantic relationships on media reprentations and a casual sex culture. There are many vids / pod casts / books, etc. by experts that explain how these patterns actually work. 
The 0 sum game mentioned means all the females want the alpha male, and all the males want the alpha female.

Though not as sharply as women’s. While men continue to produce sperm throughout their lives, several factors contribute to reduced fertility as they get older:
	1.	Decline in Sperm Quality – Sperm count, motility (movement), and morphology (shape) tend to decrease with age, making conception more difficult.
	2.	Increased DNA Damage – Older men’s sperm have a higher risk of DNA fragmentation, which can lead to a higher chance of miscarriage or genetic conditions in offspring.
	3.	Lower Testosterone Levels – Testosterone, which plays a role in sperm production, tends to decline with age, potentially reducing fertility.
	4.	Longer Time to Conception – Studies show that it often takes longer for couples to conceive when the male partner is older, even if the female partner is young.
	5.	Higher Risk of Genetic Conditions – Advanced paternal age (usually 40+) is linked to a higher risk of conditions like autism, schizophrenia, and certain genetic mutations in offspring.

While men don’t experience menopause like women, fertility gradually declines, and the risks associated with fathering children increase with age.",@larissapaixao3779,UCWSqdKHMOqjZo5ptxw2BMPA,2,2025-02-18T16:46:20Z,False,False,

Do not use dating app unless you plan to give average looking guys a chance at least having a video call. On dating apps all you have to go by is looks and a few meaningless words about their interests. Thereby you filter a lot of guys you might find interest in real life because of how charming, confident and humorous they are, which are all thins you can’t notice in dating apps. When it comes to the apps women select mostly among the top 5% of guys (this is a proven fact!). Those guys have access to about 70-80% of the women which means they are going to be players, and unless you are a top women in terms of looks no way you are gonna hold down any of these guys since when attachments haven’t been formed looks for us guys are extremely important. I know you will disregard on ignore this comment in hopes that you will secure that top guy, but you probably can’t, and I know that for you as a woman attraction can also come from a mixture of looks and a lot of other traits of masculinity, which is why I am advising you to either leave the apps or give what you think is an average or slightly above average guy at least a chance for a video call or even a quick coffee date. Best of luck out there, and also in conversations a lot of guys can’t seem to hold them because most of us (the non players) get nervous just like you guys do, yeah I know, might be a  shocking realization that a guy thats 6’4” can get nervous around a woman who is 5’4” and a waitress. Thats because for us guys dating is a skill, and the more you play the better you get and the more you get invited to play (snowball effect). So to be confidence we need to understand the game and have experience or in other words be skilled. I hope this gives you some empathy and understanding on the male perspective and I hope you find the guy you are looking for.",@teok8855,UCbMQlotnHYiU-Z3tdVdKJEg,0,2025-02-18T14:15:32Z,False,False,

Whether that's physically in work, or working on our home doing chores. That really we've got a crisis of energy levels, now more than ever people need to get tanked up on motivational things to simply get by to meet an ever demanding society.
And coming home and complaining to your neighbour (which inevitably you will)  doesn't feel like the first option in a society that is now accepting burn out and personal space. 

Space allows for personal development to become a better person and take on less habits of our neighbours that we don't like. Moderation within moderation I suppose. Yes we should spend more time in communities. Lots of us don't have neighbours who want to be social back or make the social game easy. As a neurodiverse person it's already really hard to find acceptance within society unless you're doing the system that everyone else does. For example I don't drink anymore, which completely segregates most of my UK community, because lots of people simply haven't caught up to the modern way or understand what that means. It's a fragmented societal problem I'm seeing so much of. 

No shade to Dr Hippel, I think what he's saying is truly fantastic, I just wish that the world would crank up less demand and/or hustle culture to pave the way for allowing those energy levels to exist, and not to the point of social burn out and expectation.

He's a behavioral psychologist but is still rooted in a misinformed perspective. People take these tidbits and use them to take education away or to justify their hurt egos.

Women with more education help societies and communities thrive. A major reason women don't choose men any more is because they can not provide a well rounded relationship that includes community and connection. Ask any well educated woman if they would take a ""well education man"" over a mechanic with a growth mindset & emotional maturity. Educate yourself on the things you enjoy.

Most men aren't naturally born with value; they have to create it, which is a tough process. That’s why many men tend to peak in their 30s.

A lot of men end up giving up because of what they hear or experience—expectations that they should meet '6s' (6ft, 6-figure income, etc.), which can be unrealistic. Lowering these standards might be more realistic than expecting most men to achieve them.

The men who meet those criteria are in the top % of men, and there simply aren’t enough of them to go around.

I'm not saying men shouldn't work on themselves—luckily, there’s a growing trend of men focusing on fitness, making more money, and improving themselves.

In fact, each of us today has more than ancient royalty ever did , with modern conveniences, access to information, better education, healthcare, and overall stability. Despite this, many still experience dissatisfaction and anxiety, which suggests that while we may be pursuing external things, we often overlook inner balance and true understanding of happiness.  Western culture often emphasizes individual freedom, independence, and self-realization, while Eastern culture, focuses more on collectivism, stressing the harmony and responsibility of family, society, and the nation.Collectivism is not just about pursuing ""Great Unity,"" but more about finding common goals and values in a diverse world and uniting through love and consensus.

""I mean yeah, those awful things still happen, but the nannybot 3000 deals with that for us, we just get to chill and have fun with the kid"" I'm sure you're also aware of the high rates of Post Partum Depression in mothers and how some develop serious hate and malice toward the child and some even abuse or kill the child. With a programmed nanny they could have the nanny take care of the child when they are not mentally there and could potentially be a danger to the child or themselves. They could notice dangerous behaviors and recommend resources to help them whether that be books to read, video's to watch or Dr's to see. this is definitely a very viable option if they can be mass-produced to the point where paying for one is like buying the new Iphone where you just pay a small monthly fee.",@DeanGrand,UClg6RgLsePFGxeIq7oISDIg,8,2025-02-22T12:51:52Z,False,True,UgwCgyaDHl4V1sOLSzt4AaABAg

I just happened to disagree with this one point. I clearly disagree with your statement.  People who don't want to have children should not have children. My children are 23 and 25; I loved every moment of raising them (even during the difficult times), and they are good caring, loving citizens.

No child should have parents who don't want them. If anything should be changed, it should be the way our society views children. Children are not the problem.

I agree that people who don't want children should not have them, but that is just not the reality or world that we do or ever will live in. many men and women have sex  for pleasure and not procreation, the act sometimes results in unwanted pregnancies, and for whatever reason, whether it be religious, or family pressure, or guilt, or laws stopping the mother from aborting the unwanted child,  tens of millions of children are  born every year unwanted. Some parents rise to the occasion and find it in their hearts to love and care for  their ""surprise"" children, but that's just not that case for a large number of people across the globe. In many cases, the ""parents"" keep the life before the child, they focus on work, their social life, drugs, alcohol, whatever they had before and neglect the needs of the child sometimes leaving them in abusive homes until CPS  comes to take them from these toxic/abusive homes, but then they end up in foster care which is not always much better for them. 

I do agree that society does not understand the importance of raising and being involved in the childrens lives but I also think that the economic structure than many live in today simply doesn't allow parents to be parents unless they are some sort of ""super mom/dad"" who can manage those 40-80 hr work weeks just to put food on the table and a roof over their heads and still are able to force themselves to be actively involved in the childs lives even when they are physically and emotionally drained. I think that having an aide (human or synthetic) for these parents who don't have to energy to be parents, to aide in everyday time consuming hassles, preparing meals, doing dishes, laundry, cleaning the house, all those hours of mundane tasks we have to do on a daily basis, can be converted to 1 on 1 time with their children strengthening bonds. now i don't think the robots should be doing everything in the house forever. but those initial years of the childs life would be important in providing the parents with more bonding time and less time dealing with the chores of life. Ideally for me once the kids are of age to start learning everyday life skills that would be the time for the synthetic nanny to be less involved and have the parent teach those skills (have the kids learn to make meals, clean up the house, make their beds etc).

 I don't disagree with your ideal world but I just find it a bit closeminded to completely discredit a hypothetical and very realistic future that SOME (not all) future parents may want to entertain. I don't think any Rational person is asking for robots to completely replace parents. That is definitely not what I am hearing from this gentleman at the very least.",@DeanGrand,UClg6RgLsePFGxeIq7oISDIg,0,2025-02-22T15:59:12Z,False,True,UgwCgyaDHl4V1sOLSzt4AaABAg

I work with lots of doctors; nearly all of whom, drive expensive cars. But they don't get any enjoyment out of driving those cars, but I get lots of enjoyment out of driving my 40 year old Porsche every few weekends instead of EVERY DAY. Why? Because whatever you do or have all the time, you automatically consider ordinary, not really something  you enjoy, because it's no longer special. To me, my Porsche is enjoyable, because I don't have it all the time, every day. So I have three old vehicles instead of one new one, and whenever I switch vehicles, they seem sort of 'new' to me again, and I get to enjoy something different about them as opposed to what I drove for the past week or so. I used to have a motorcycle, too, and when I was young, I drove it every day to save money on gas. Doing that, made it seem like nothing special, even though it was a top end high performance motorcycle. But it became 'just transportation' because it was all I used. Just as if you own a Ferrari, if you use it all the time, it becomes 'the car'. JUST the car. Because you have it all the time, you don't appreciate all the great things about it, because it becomes nothing special.

For centuries, they have imposed laws and social structures that limited women’s independence, masking control as ""provisioning"" while consolidating material power for themselves.

He argued that women need men for provision during pregnancy, yet many men today struggle to provide even for themselves. Their actions often stem from ego—not true leadership or support, but a desire to maintain status among their peers. A man may answer only to himself, yet he still seeks validation from a woman.

The decline in sexual relationships isn’t due to a lack of desire from women—it’s because men are no longer perceived as essential. Remove reproduction from the equation, and what remains? Women form deeper, more fulfilling interpersonal relationships with one another.

Beyond material needs, there is a spiritual and psychological dimension to this shift—one tied to identity. Men are grappling with their place in a world where expectations have changed, competition looks different, and traditional roles no longer guarantee respect or purpose. To move forward, they must confront and heal their egos, redefining masculinity on their own terms. It will be a painful but necessary process—one that cannot be avoided if they wish to be truly seen and valued by women.",@jacquelinee1220,UCNh2saMJKXpd3Zn_Z84erqQ,0,2025-02-17T23:52:30Z,False,False,

Lord. While there are some men who have indeed help “advance” our society…there are so many who lack foresight, connecting the dots, and think they are solving a problem, only to have generations later see the horrific consequences. We can see this in so many things throughout history. 

I am a mother, grandmother, who was an RN, and am now in neuroscience and cognitive science, have worked with babies to geriatrics. Our nervous system is so intricate, wonderful, sensitive, and we develop and grow through connections that are often non-verbal, that no robot could possibly have. It is the R brain to R brain connection that Dr Alan Schore talks of, that is essential for healthy brain development and future relationships. 
This cannot happen with robots. 

Maybe we should run by the suggestion that men be put elsewhere and replaced with robots??? How would this “expert” evolutionary psychologist think this would play out? 

Goodness, this is disheartening.

The hypothesis is that the act of caring for babies/children (and the ""paces"" it puts us through) serves the evolutionary purpose of compelling the maturation of the adult. 

It is not the ""only"" way, of course. But if you take it away, the result may be adults with even less resilience, self-discipline, etc.

To be fair to the guest, if he has a newborn at home - he wouldn't be the first person to wish for some ""magical someone"" to help out, LOL.  However, even this feeling/need pushes parents to ""get out"" and meet other parents to share some of the load (meet for playgroups, watch each other's children, etc.)

My hope is that we can create intentional childcare/school/neighborhood community centers to recreate the multi-generational extended family structures of the past (a place where both adults and children can get their developmental needs met while sharing and working alongside others). Gardens, canning/other food storage, classes in various skills (bread making, personal finance, DYI home repairs/building, auto maintenance, sewing/knitting, etc.), as well as potluck dinners, music/poetry readings, and so on, could take place there (as the community wants them).

I think this would work better than robots for addressing the isolation and lack of social interactions that your guest properly identified.

I've often pointed out that we created spaces like gyms to offset the effects of our modern sedentary lifestyles. However, we have failed to create and provide environments that replace essential experiences needed for healthy human development.  I believe, if we do this, we can fix many (if not most) of the problems that we are currently facing.",@4whirledpeas,UCDKE_9aio-GOiCFrQF6nSKQ,36,2025-02-18T15:43:47Z,False,True,UgzY_n9X9rc6Fo8DilJ4AaABAg

If you cannot connect the dots between what men have achieved to what women have done in the background..not to mention, the plethora of women in science, engineering, and more, who have achieved many things that contribute collectively…then you are blind. Women who provided support for the men, raised the children, did as much to help society (and its advancement, if not more) Nothing happens in a vacuum. There is far more interconnectivity than you can possibly fathom. 
I sense you have many, many blind spots. 

And yes, sometimes we can’t predict things 50-100 years down the road…however, the ability to be patient, consider many perspectives, look at a 360 degree view as much as possible, get input from many people, connecting dots, redefining “success” (it’s far more important to have high relationship skills than oodles of money (which is where much of our society has gone utterly sideways))…and not having financial profit (at the cost of other risks) be the main driver. 

Lastly, there have been many things released, that had had concerns raised, and they were discounted. Many times, the concerns (and more) did come to fruition. One of many examples, is things like the drug Percocet. Things have a ripple effect. 
Look at technology, and kids, the dopamine hijacking, the ripple of decreased true social connection, poor emotional regulation (worse than in the past), addiction to devices and the “anesthetic” they provide, avoidance of uncomfortable feelings (which are part and parcel of life). With the smartphone, we have created an unbelievable health crisis, mental, emotional, social, physical…and if you don’t “get” it, the increase your depth and widen your aperture. 
Seems you are stuck in a quagmire of cogntive distortions, limiting beliefs, and sadly believe every thought that comes in your head. 
If you can do one thing to improve your life…start with not believing all your thoughts. Examine them.

Is it in the context of your work?  If so, I can understand that, since the primary purpose of your work is to allow parents to work. However, in the scientific community, this is a heavy topic. For example, Dr. Lipton emphasizes the importance of the prenatal environment and early childhood experiences in shaping a child's development. He argues that parents' perceptions and attitudes can significantly influence their child's genetic expression and overall well-being. Dr. Burke Harris, a pediatrician and researcher, has been instrumental in raising awareness about the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on long-term health and well-being, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and trauma-informed care. Dr. Suskind, the founder and director of the Thirty Million Words Initiative, focuses on early language development and its impact on children's future success.

Since you asked,  the ""primary"" purpose of my job is not to allow parents to work.  From birth to three, Montessori specialists can include post-partum doulas,  some do ""home visits"" (like in the PAT program),  others provide resources to help parents set up ""Montessori in the home,""  or *offer weekly Parent/Child classes (to help offset isolation and provide a way for ""stay at home"" parents - or other caregivers like grandparents or nannies - to connect and find support in their local communities* ) ... as well as to provide care in infant and/or toddler prepared environments (at a Montessori school).  Montessori pedagogy is also popular with homeschooling parents. 

I would LOVE to see any of the people on your list on *podcasts like this*!  That was actually the point that I was trying to make :)

Adding: Forbes magazine just published an article (Feb 2025) called *The Surprising Health Benefits Of Montessori Education*  A researcher in the article said that one reason for the health outcomes is that ""Montessori education is a much closer match to the conditions we evolved for"" (which is interesting given that Dr. Von Hippel is an 'evolutionary specialist').",@4whirledpeas,UCDKE_9aio-GOiCFrQF6nSKQ,3,2025-03-01T18:40:14Z,False,True,UgzY_n9X9rc6Fo8DilJ4AaABAg

However, the “mundane” tasks, like changing diapers, feeding children, trying their shoes, are all chances for the R brain to R brain nervous system attunement, which helps children with regulation later on. 
The consistent, every day, opportunities for attachment, are what contributes to potential secure attachment (which is powerful beyond understanding, in all future relationships). 
In today’s world, that is already lacking greatly in the majority of children’s lives. Assign robots will not help, and will contribute instead to further increase in insecure attachment styles, higher levels of loneliness, disconnection (from self and others), higher divorce rates, higher addiction and mental illness… 
If you cannot appreciate the interconnectedness (the web and domino effect to put it ultra-simplistically) than you do not understand much about humans, their brains (and then minds), how they relate, where behavior comes from…and how the very core, foundation, is created from the bond (or lack of) with primary caregivers. 
A robot supplementing is not the answer. A robot has no place in childcare. 
A robot going to a child who is crying in the night is not soothing to the nervous system. Our nervous systems communicate with one another, a robot does not have the nervous system, the unspoken messages (way beyond the surface) to connect, soothe, and help a child’s nervous system be healthy. 

Robots might be fine for dishes, washing clothes, vacuuming, but not attunement oriented (nervous system related) tasks. 

If you want a more chaotic, dysfunctional society, then robots for childcare are an answer. Even if they did 20%, it’s still problematic…and who places the limits on how much? 
There are much better potential solutions for better family dynamics.",@Alphacentauri819,UCv1vCFuWf6XVhcKtoaxe4hg,6,2025-03-02T07:10:25Z,False,True,UgzY_n9X9rc6Fo8DilJ4AaABAg

My hypothesis is that screens are easy.  You get immediate gratification.  But dealing with other humans is hard.  You have to wait your turn.  Decipher what they mean, or need. Figure out what to say.  It takes practice.  

But we are also talking about younger children - like newborns.  So, I'll ask how you felt when you watched The Matrix and saw the babies hooked up to the machines?  How do you think the child will feel when they realize the ""person"" they gave their love to wasn't really a person at all?  When I work with parents or 0-3 specialists, we say things like, ""When giving a child a bottle, stay connected. Don't have your phone out, or watch TV, etc. Be with that child.  We are laying the foundation for healthy attachment and relationships. The child should feel valued and loved."" 

If we are going to make robots that are ""more human than humans"" then what is the point of being human?  And to return to my original response, if we are willing to pay top dollar and spend unlimited energy to create some sort of PhD super nanny robot ... why haven't we been willing to pay real people to get the training and support they'd need to do the same thing?

I may be wrong, but I will guess that (without Googling it) you may not know much about Montessori theory.  And that would be BECAUSE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT the various SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT relating to the first years of life and childhood in general.  Do we talk about Dynamic Systems Theory?  the Developmental Origins of  Health and Disease?  Sensitive Periods of Brain Development?   (The brain is 85% adult size by age 3 and 90% volume by age 5 or 6. )

I said this in an earlier post, but I will say it again.  We have created GYMS and WORKOUT routines because we have acknowledged that modern sedentary life does not provide needed environment/movement opportunities for healthy adults.  WHAT WE ARE FAILING TO SEE is the way that modern life IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH healthy human development (aka childhood).  In the book ENDANGERED MINDS - WHY OUR CHILDREN DON'T THINK  (1990),  Dr. Jane Healy said that the brains of children today resemble those of patients with traumatic brain injuries...except rather than loosing functions...they are never being developed in the first place.  (And things have gotten worse, not better, since 1990 - and now those kids are having kids.)  If you want to know THE CAUSE of so many of the social problems we are facing - it is that we are no longer meeting the biological needs of human development.  

We simply cannot thrive in any domain (physical, cognitive, social/emotional, communication, adaptive/resilient) if basic biological requirements are absent.   This is not a political topic.  It is a physiological reality. This isn't about telling people how to raise their children.  It's about information and awareness. Early childhood experiences impact long-term physycial and mental health as well as human capital, productivity,  social skills, contributions to teams/community and so on.   

There is actually NO TOPIC MORE IMPORTANT.   Adults must intentionally PROVIDE essential environments to protect human flourishing during formative years

We already have others raising our children for us (daycare workers and teachers) who are not emotionally invested in our children, who are essentially just showing up to get a paycheck. The situation is not so different from robots raising our children and this is the problem, that parents have abdicated their role and responsibility to others for the sake of pursuing the almighty dollar. 
Yes, it is more difficult financially and requires sacrifice for one parent to stay home and raise the children. It is much more physically and emotionally demanding to raise children properly, than any 8-5 job, but it is also far more important and far more rewarding (when done correctly) than any other job. I decided long before I had children, that I would live in a tent before I would allow someone else to raise my child!

Not because it will cease to exist, but because linear humans will better understand the purpose and usefulness ie value of ND individuals. I believe we are evolving to a state where the gifts of being ND will be called upon.

Meanwhile, he has already laid out the numbers. 3 women to 1 guy on campus. Women choose the top 20% of men. 80% of men are ignored because of hypergamy(call it what it is). Women are blasted with hundreds of opportunities while men get almost none in comparison even though the man and women are of the same quality. Somehow, he says young men are having less sex because of better porn and they are lazy.... am I missing something? Or is he just oblivious to his OWN findings and studies. Hey guy, add up the bullshit bud. Women are getting pickier while men who aren't getting play are giving up knowing that fact. It's been around for 20+ years now. This information has been touted for 20+ years and those men have been on terrorism lists and called misogynistic. How about we put the blame where it belongs for ONCE. So we can actually solve the problem.

Edit: he thinks it's smilshingxyz or whatever he called it. No, its social media and dating apps have amplified womens hypergamy into levels never seen before.

The ‘magic’ of life & love, connection, fun, laughter, appreciation of nature & each other? Getting robot nannies & thinking that would teach children about what it is to be human? We seem to be moving further & further from that? 
What is it to be human? What of our sense of something more than ourselves; a higher purpose, being, meaning, calling? As a species, this is a part of our evolutionary DNA as well… as seen through all cultures- it wouldn’t still be a part of us if it wasn’t needed, wanted for survival. 

This seems slightly slanted on a ‘middle class’ bias (?) (as quite a bit of research is..) Research is only as good as the questions  asked & the cross sectional sample groups & the researchers’ data. 

I’m hoping that I’m not in a minority… we chose to have one income (under £24,000) so that I could bring up our children. I later returned to work. Our children & family life were happy.

I will say once the computer/internet entered my house, my husband's interest in me disappeared. Considering that internet access & porn is ubiquitous, I'm sure most women would feel their sex lives have been changed drastically as well. It's also a known fact women are largely less happy with marriage & children, because they do the lion's share of the work (emotional & physical,) plus are expected to hold a job & bring in a salary. I will say kindness is #1 on my list and more so with each passing year. Happier people are more agreeable in general.

However, the data Steven presented did not come from a reputable source but was also worded in what appeared to be in a way to promote a bias that “50% of women want a man taller than her”without clarifying by how much. Does he have to be an inch taller? 3 inches? The
*data presented does not specify* which I would think is VERY important given that the average height for women in the UK & US is 5’4 & average height for men is 5’9 in US & 5’10 in the UK.

Then it was presented that a vast majority of women want men 8 inches taller than them, when what the data he was using actually stated was it was *only 15% of all women* specifically want that height difference. 

Sometimes I feel Steven himself & asking questions of his guests that still push a *red pill* narrative. “They choose the nice guys over the better hunters”, which I heard as “nice guys bare better than Chad’s”.

1) Modern American women (for the most part) don't have the mindset to be long term partners to men.
(Partly dew to social media.)

As a rule they are lazy, selfish, uncooperative and unsupportive. 

They don't understand that a RELATIONSHIP is about give and take.

They're happy to take but not so much to give.

The idea of sacrifice today for the future is pretty foreign to them. 

Again most, not all.

2) Robots?!!? REALLY!!!???

I believe that the Dr. is correct about making having children as much of a positive thing and less of a negative, but robots are a pretty foolish answer.

Far better to structure society so that a couple can afford to raise a family without spending all their time working for money enough to slip slowly into deep poverty.

If you have to make 6 figures to afford a family then the economy needs work. 

How many more hours are mom and dad going to have to work to be able to buy a robot nanny?

I'm sure that what the Dr. is talking about will be at least as much as a new car.

Far better IN MY OPINION to enable parents to work less and pay less to care for themselves and their offspring.",@kenkneram4819,UCRDxY3BIV8KNwSn9Y0MC18g,0,2025-02-17T15:29:02Z,False,False,

Was it taken into account that this is a small tribe who has not changed their way of living for thousands of years unlike Westerns? He points out they have “no money in the bank”, well yeah. That is not their currency. Do they have a form of currency necessary to survive day to day like Westerns do with money?

A woman will always be sexually attracted to a good looking sexy youngish/virile man, even if they choose partners considering other factors. An old rich man can pull a young woman by virtue of offering resources, but that is economy, not evolution, and not the same as sexual attraction. Besides, people used to live to 35-40 only, so this is relevant in evolutionary terms - saying today, when people live to 100, that men are forever fertile and young women have evolved to be attracted to them if they have status despite their looks is absurd and just wrong.

I do think that many many people have a strong desire to have children, not just sex, but for societal reasons, that has been declining for the first time in human history

This is why we creates condoms and birth control. They allow men and women to equalize their sexual desire and ignore the biological and subconscious consequences. Take away birth control and finding a competent mate instantly becomes a primary goal for many women. Boom! Birthrate collapse occurs post 60s.

2. Feminism has freed women from the feminine role. The status game they watched men doing seems like more fun until technology frees women and allows them to function the same. Then they fail in their own circles to pay attention to hypergamy and what it’s done to their standards. There’s not enough men who meet their standard the higher they go and the further we are from nature.

In 1940, less than 5% of the 25-and-older population had completed college (which probably means about 9% of men, since college women were a rarity).

Now that women have the same access to college as men, we see women flourishing in the classroom.  Men are still getting more degrees today than in 1940, so it might not be that men have given up.  Instead, part of the reason why men aren't performing as well as women in college could be that men on average are just not as well suited to classrooms, studying, and college as women are, and women's lack of access to college blinded us from seeing that difference in men and women until recently.

Religions restrict sexual behavior in some ways, which encourages marriages of some kind, and usually religions encourage people to raise children to follow their faith.  I wonder if having school choice that includes religious schools, including for vocational and university education, would raise the birth rate.  Having school choice across the educational spectrum might result in quality non-profit vocational schools that cater to men.  If you put the vocational program on the college campus (small, Christian liberal arts college, mostly women), and have both groups participate in chapel and mandatory service project trips, then people would meet marriage minded people.  Unfortunately, even though most private non-profit schools at all levels spend less per pupil than state schools, students pay much more to go to the small private liberal art colleges.  These families and students end up going into debt to pay for the education, even though the state school charges less.  This disparity in funding probably affects ultimate family size.  If these students received the exact same subsidy as the public university student, they would have less debt, and since these people generally want to marry and have three or four children (if they can afford it).  In 19th century America, most schools had some element of religion, most charitable activities were religious and so were many societies for young people, such as the Chataquaua movement.  Most people lived in small towns with lots of church participation, but most people were very poor.  Nevertheless, the religious values helped prevent out of wedlock births and the temperance movement helped curb some of the out of control drinking.  We can learn a lot from studying the values and habits of the small farmers, small businessmen and skilled workers.  Many of practices and values they had  have been lost in secular education and urbanization, to everyone's long term detriment.",@barbarabrooks4747,UCmILFnLELkquVpj-Yi-ThLQ,0,2025-02-17T13:49:10Z,False,False,

There is science behind a child being breast fed and on formula... So ... I mean there is one downside already. I think there would be many more. Interesting and thought provoking...

And they stay for so many reasons. I read a psychological paper a long time ago that researched financial independence of women and what that meant for divorce. And it is actually shocking how big the percentage of women from the boomer generation and older is, that stayed in loveless or even abusive marriages because they raised the kids, were out of the work force for too long and would not have been able to support themselves after divorcing. Divorce rates are going up in today's age also for these reasons dissapearing: most couples are double income households and the women can afford to leave. As for personal reasons to stay, it usually goes deeper than just your attractiveness. Mostly people get attached, don't want to hurt the other, maybe had great intimacy, still hope to be able to change their partner or feel they have already invested too much to start new (kids are a huge issue: staying together for the family and losing all value on the dating market as a single mother). None of this is about the muscle mass, height, hair, sexyness or income of the partner. 😅 Not to mention what value longevity of shitty relationships even has. 😅",@isibisi87,UC_yF8KJ3xOdGzxTMZ7EElbg,0,2025-02-18T20:55:01Z,False,True,UgyDuOW5c-Sh0fkYjYJ4AaABAg

It is a proven fact that in the last 20 years of the global sexual marketplace, that women are only interested in the top 10%ers, and everyone else are invisible.

It is also why when they reach 30 and they believe they can't compete anymore, they start looking for Mr good enough (beta male), but that guy always has to compete against some guy in her past that rocked her world.

And for the women in their 30''s, the high value men they are after (because of the woman's degree, top job and high body count) is of no interest to the man in his 30's who can date a woman in her 20's who is not a boss bitch.

And so that leaves the nice guys, who in their 20's who got no attention and were ignored as they saw the girls getting run through by Chad and Tyrone, but then when they reach their 30's and suddenly the 30 year old women want them, they have no interest in them after being rejected for 10 years.

When in fact this top percentage on the app is only consuming women and thus way less discerning then they will be when they are looking for a wife. These stats cover the women that are on the app for attention. They are not true for the women that are aware of what they bring into a relationship and are looking for a comparable match. That is a huge difference. And for these realistic and genuine women, navigating the manipulation, lies, and flat out fraud of men on dating apps is as frustrating and eroding as OP stated. These ""nice guys"" you mention don't get swiped away by these genuine women. Unless they are actually not nice, only weaponize and instrumentalize their pretended kindness to manipulate women into a meeting them. When in fact they have the very same mindset of the users: that women are an accessory to their life, any emotion or opinion or need makes them ""difficult"", feminists are the worst thing and bodycount is an issue. 😅 Any of these hit a spot? Then it is not a nice guy. Women are people, with the exact same right to have a life and partner according to their core values as men do. And those are not ""inflated standards"" or ""unrealistic expectations"". They are a mirror of what these women know they bring into the relationship as well. I have never met a self proclaimed ""nice guy"" who complained about not being chosen, who didn't turn out to be a user.

I have to disagree with your perspective, especially when you talk about women “thinking they’re worth more than they are.” That comment is not only deeply crude but completely misses the point. A woman’s worth should never be tied to anything external—especially not her appearance or who swipes right on her. Worth is inherent, simply because she is a human being. The real issue here is the superficial view of dating apps and society in general, which reduces people to mere checkboxes and appearance. This kind of thinking only fuels disappointment and unrealistic expectations.

Women have every right to filter and be discerning. The documented facts show that men are far more likely to engage in predatory behavior, scams, and catfishing, so women’s choices are about protecting themselves in a space full of deception. If anything, a man who has a decent photo, shows he takes care of his hygiene, and fills out his profile coherently and thoughtfully is already in good standing. These are the basics for forming a real connection—not some narrow, shallow checklist based on looks or a false sense of “worth.” Let’s face it: the deeper issue is that these kinds of app dynamics reflect a bigger societal problem, where superficiality often overshadows genuine connection.",@merakiansoul1111,UCMvTJI2QT9uMl03V4ZLiWYw,60,2025-02-17T11:49:39Z,False,True,Ugwd9lYgZRhwubXVdCB4AaABAg

There's also crosscultural and crossnational data from China and other countries. The ONLY two difficult things women have on dating apps are: literally too many options and that they overwhelmingly pick the same top percentage of men so they have to compete and share. 

All of the data shows that women OVERWHELMINGLY discard the bottom 80% of men, at 80%+ some men get SOME attention, at 90%+ it ramps up a bit again and then at 99% they virtually get ALL of the attention. You can google the HINGE graph for this data in particular but it has also been replicated on other sites and in speed dating scenarios without dating apps. This does not happen on the other side of the equation. Data also shows that it is NOT personality or how funny he is or anything like that, it's how tall he is, how good looking he is and if he is successful (travel/apartment/luxury/etc). 

I do not blame you for your biology but please stop, just STOP ALREADY, bashing men. It is unwarranted and all this male bashing needs to stop already. YOU have, in absolute numbers, almost all of the cards when it comes to online dating unless you are in the bottom 20% (it's the reverse when it comes to women).

If we just take the numbers as they are, that women select very strictly and only swipe right on 20% of men on apps, then how can we change this? And as the Dr. here said: what makes a good partner is mostly an internal quality. Kindness, and being able and willing to protect and care for her (through emotional intelligence, financial stability and WANTING to show up as a full person and acknowledge her as such). Plus health and attractiveness which are externally visible for the most part and also highly individualistic. These 20% of top men on apps must then show these qualities significantly better than the rest, no? Because all women can look to for these qualities are the man's pictures and profile texts.
Have you seen profiles lately? 😅 Most don't care to invest and write nothing, or write down their lists of physical needs or spew really disgusting frustration and hate about this dating process. And the pictures are usually super unflattering, the person is barely visible, in a group of other men or super pretentious (sitting on their car, shouting with a beer in hand, being wasted). The same, btw, is true for the profiles of a lot of women. 😅 But you see how difficult it is to gage the potential of that person based off this very limited information, right? And then people make the experience that a lot of what is shown is a lie. Everyone enjoys showing themselves in the best light. As what they think the other person wants. But that is not what they ARE. And nobody wants to date potential, they want to date a real, mature, finished adult. 😅 All of this is true for both sexes.
In short: those 80% of left-swiped profiles are either super void of information or have enough unwanted information. For most normal people that don't put any effort into their profiles and can't just cash in on their amazing looks, dating apps don't work without some investment. From my experience, two thirds of these 80% of men would have really good success if they invested some thought into their profile and stayed honest.",@isibisi87,UC_yF8KJ3xOdGzxTMZ7EElbg,0,2025-02-17T15:40:41Z,False,True,Ugwd9lYgZRhwubXVdCB4AaABAg

Not necessarily. 

Men desire beauty first.

Then we evaluate personality and character. 

The first question we answer when meeting a new woman is ""Is she attractive enough that I would...?"" 

Only if the answer to this question is in the affirmative do we care about and evaluate the rest.

Personality and character will seal the deal but a woman's looks are what open the door for her in the first place.

I would say the same to many women.

I'm good looking, responsible, don't drink, smoke or do drugs.

I don't have any children or ""baby mommas."" 

I own land and my own home, a truck, a tractor and  pay my own bills.

I'm very responsible with money and budget carefully.

By all other measurements I'm a terrific catch.

BUT!

I have a neurological condition and am on Social Security Disability.

My income is too low to be deemed worthy.

My dating pool includes welfare breeders and fat slobs who chafe at the slightest hint of expectation. 

At minimum I expect a potential partner to take care of her body, not have children and clean up after herself.

Apparently that's too much. 😏

I'm no longer willing to get married.

I have too much to lose and too little ability to recover from a greedy divorce.

Plus, American women simply aren't worthy of my attention. (Fat, lazy, dirty, irresponsible, wasteful, single mothers just looking for a meal ticket.)

You can post someone else's picture on a profile. 

It's still very difficult to fake a video chat.

Not one of the women that I was looking at were willing to comply with my rule. Which by the way would have advantaged them as well because then they would have known that I really was who and what I said I was.

Men will literally listen to a man’s take on the female experience sooner than that of an actual woman, and I’m beyond sick of it. So many men do not see us as human, just playthings for their amusement.

Maybe try making a thoughtful and interesting dating profile with nice photos? And forming a genuine connection not based only on a woman’s physical beauty? You do know that everyone gets old, wrinkled and possibly sick/disabled at some point, right?

Guys love to think women only want tall men with money, when not one woman I know cares much about either of those things. If you’ve got emotional intelligence, confidence, and you take care of yourself, you are already 99% of the way there. Unfortunately, such a man is a unicorn.

For one, you'll never know anyway. But more importantly, eventually I learned that women who will admit they have had, ideally, anything in excess of 50 sexual partners are much, much more fun to spend time with than those with very low numbers, who often have low numbers for a reason. Sometimes crippling intimacy issues. It's not just a sexual thing, women who have dated a bit know a lot more about how relationships and the world in general works. They are just generally more interesting people, with better social skills etc. 
I worked out that wanting a woman with a low body count was actually a sign of my insecurity. I wanted to be the best guy she'd ever known and my lack of self confidence told me that would be easier if I met a girl who'd only had a couple of guys before. But when you're the best guy she's ever known (she says... But what else do we have to go on) and you also know she's had a load of other guys, and is therefore qualified to have an opinion- that really means something more.

Women have the greater risks of pregnancy or attack—and of death from both—so they’re going to be choosier as they take those risks. A wealthier man is theoretically a better provider for their offspring, and I’m guessing most of the top men have higher incomes in addition to being more physically attractive. Even a poor but handsome man at least triggers the ‘good genes’ instinct that many men use to justify wanting women more attractive than themselves. Yes, men are willing to sleep with a greater proportion of women than women are of men, but they’re not giving them a chance romantically and are very often lying just to get laid. Men who want actual relationships can be much more certain that a woman is dating them because she wants the same thing than the other way around. Only women who want casual sex can be reasonably sure that’s what the men they’re sleeping with are really interested in. It’s a fundamental mismatch between most women and most men, and it sucks, but men aren’t going to simply start being better and neither are women, especially not with so many complaining about the other sex as a whole instead of focusing on other people (including of their own sex) and themselves as individuals. Feminists are accused of that, and so is the manosphere. Before anyone accuses me of the same, what I’ve stated about risks and proportions is simply the truth. There is obviously no point in anyone dating without understanding and accepting the risks and realities.",@TruthSetsUsFreeSoSayWe,UCvKb3FKbf5F5-mYFyZkMOJA,1,2025-06-04T01:12:51Z,False,True,Ugwd9lYgZRhwubXVdCB4AaABAg

This statement of yours is well thought out and presented. But based on feelings rather than fact. Sure men CAN be more predatory in the physical sense but women can be extremely predatory in other ways in relationships too. And you think being spoiled for choice but having to sift through it all is exhausting, trust me you don't understand how bad the otherside of that coin is. Having extremely few options and NO amount of pictures, description of yourself, kindness, or conversation skills can overcome what women do to us on dating apps. I implore you create a dating profile and choose a guy that by 5 other girls accounts ranks about a 5-6/10 then start messaging women to try to get a date. There's a famous tictok girl that did do this for her friend who she admits is about a 6 in appearance as a man and she admitted it was wayyyyyy worse than what she thought it would be.

We are already overcrowding this planet, and we are already automating many jobs to robots and/or AI. We have poverty, unemployment, pandemics and wars.

The only problem we don't have is human extinction.

Also, if we really want to solve a bunch of problems, let's introduce next rule: a couple may only have a baby if the couple's parents are at least 25% different skin color. That means the child has one to three black grandparents, one to three white grandparents, one to three asian grandparents etc.

you want the mother to have fat on her tights and bum..!?!? - So which one...? 
2. He didn't evenen mention thelat Women NEED FAT on their BELLY!

There are already a billion humans around the world who are starving and malnourished because of animal slave farming, 85% of them are children. 

Shifting diets from animal-based to plant-based at the global level is of paramount importance in achieving food security and sustainability goals. Decreasing consumption of animal products such as dairy, eggs and flesh will free up large amounts of food that could be consumed directly by humans—for example, soy and grains. 

At the current trends of food consumption and environmental changes, food security and food sustainability are on a collision course. Changing course (to avoid the collision) will require extreme downward shifts in meat and dairy consumption by large segments of the world’s population.

Policies in favor of the global adoption of plant-based diets will simultaneously optimize the food supply, health, environmental, and social justice outcomes for the world’s population. Implementing such nutrition policy is perhaps one of the most rational and moral paths for a sustainable future of the human race and other living creatures of the biosphere that we share.

It reduces women to nothing more than their biological ability to have children, completely ignoring everything else that makes a person valuable in a relationship—intelligence, kindness, emotional depth, humor, shared values, and life experience.

For someone to suggest that love is no longer an option for older women is to dismiss the countless relationships that form later in life—beautiful, meaningful partnerships that have nothing to do with fertility and everything to do with connection. It’s a cruel narrative that can leave women feeling unworthy or invisible, as if their ability to be loved expires with their ability to conceive.

But that’s simply not reality. People fall in love at every stage of life. Many women in their 40s, 50s, and beyond find deeper, more fulfilling relationships because they know themselves better, they won’t settle for less, and they bring wisdom and confidence that younger versions of themselves didn’t yet have.

A man who thinks a woman’s worth in love is tied to her fertility is revealing his own limited, transactional view of relationships. That’s his problem, not ours. The truth is, the kind of love that actually matters—the kind that lasts—is about so much more than biology.

It’s not all men and it’s certainly not something that should be stated in a podcast like this as it is not factual and it is extremely sexist. Saying that a woman’s attractiveness is based on her fertility is a reductive and outdated view that can come across as misogynistic, even if it’s rooted in evolutionary psychology. While biological factors may play a role in what people find attractive, reducing a woman’s value to her reproductive capability ignores her individuality, personality, intelligence, and agency.

People are not just biological beings but also social and emotional ones. In modern society, attraction is shaped by a wide range of factors, including personal compatibility, emotional connection, shared interests, and mutual respect. Stating that fertility is what makes a woman attractive not only dismisses women who are infertile or past childbearing age but also reinforces a narrow and limiting view of female worth.

Should people say it? Well, they can, but they should also expect pushback. It’s not inherently wrong to discuss biological influences on attraction, but when phrased in an absolute way, it dehumanizes women and reduces them to their biological functions rather than seeing them as whole people.",@merakiansoul1111,UCMvTJI2QT9uMl03V4ZLiWYw,4,2025-02-17T15:06:59Z,False,True,UgwLymXy_CgNVE6UYup4AaABAg

It challenges the idea that women lose value or attractiveness once they are no longer fertile. It suggests that postmenopausal women have played a crucial evolutionary role, not just in their families but in society as a whole.

Here’s how it counters the fertility-based argument:
	1.	Survival Advantage – Unlike most mammals, human women live long past their reproductive years because their wisdom and experience provide benefits to the community. Evolution would not favor longevity if a woman’s value were only tied to fertility.
	2.	Wisdom and Influence – Older women hold valuable knowledge, from survival strategies to social dynamics. In many cultures, they are respected as leaders, healers, and advisors. This shows that a woman’s worth extends far beyond youth and fertility, rooted in her accumulated insight and ability to guide others.
	3.	Long-Term Bonds vs. Short-Term Attraction – If human attraction were purely about fertility, emotional intelligence and long-term bonds wouldn’t matter so much. Men across cultures appreciate wisdom, humor, and companionship—qualities that only deepen with age.

So, the idea that a woman is only attractive when fertile is outdated.

Furthermore, regarding your point about attraction going far beyond biology, that's probably true for some cases but false for the majority. I'm the type of man who also looks beyond a woman's appearance and I certainly feel like a small minority. That said, I still notice and am attracted to markers of health in women (skin, hair, overall fitness, hip to waist ration makes my brain light up, etc.), despite not necessarily wanting kids, although that may also be the case because I place a high value on health. 

Either way, no matter how disturbing it sounds, the idea that a lot of a woman's value is tied to her ability to have children is true for probably most cases, just as it is for men's ability to gather resources. However, this doesn't mean that a woman who can't have children is undesirable but it does mean that she will be less desirable than her fertile copy. 

All in all, I do agree with your point that we shouldn't add even more weight on people's backs when it comes to measuring their self worth because we're already at an all time high.

However, I think this conversation may not be relevant to you, assuming you're not looking for a man or planning to start a family.

This discussion is about the dynamics of relationships, what women value in men and what men value in women. It’s really that simple. I’ve never said women have no value. I’ve only said that, in some cases, their value may be perceived as less due to certain factors. The same way a man can be less valuable to a woman if he doesn't meet her standards...

A silver medal is still valuable, but it’s less valuable than a gold one.

If you ask most parents what their greatest life choice and source of happiness is, the answer will almost always be, 'my kids.'

If you're happy without kids or a partner and don’t want either, that's great for you, but that makes you the exception to the rule.",@EYBeats,UCEAOI-xD6E6-He35rXA87Aw,1,2025-02-18T13:26:10Z,False,True,UgwLymXy_CgNVE6UYup4AaABAg

Also the same men who compete/kill/belittle each other and refuse to be kind for kindness sake, want to know why they are lonely?

Further more  women needs to pay much more attention in the swiping as if they match with a predator, then it would be the female's fault for swapping and meeting a random guy if she get attacked or receives a ""unsolicited pictures"". While a male do not have to care at all about this, will always find more attractive profiles and quite often won't even look at them as there is the ""swipe all right"" habits which is designed to simply maximise the chances of a match... So before judging females for being ""being too picky"" I'd like to remind you that's not simply the nice car we are looking for, it's simple security and effort that changes the Ballance of swiping.",@elisasavioli811,UCZXqAR0HIeH4blFzTNrDNoQ,1,2025-02-18T10:40:31Z,False,True,UgzRjADZGHERcaWxY254AaABAg

It is more likely to be based on passed experiences, because future doesn't exist yet, and what's causing the anxiety is expectations (good or bad), that are built from passed experiences. We could even discuss the concept of present; at some degree, humans only experience life retrospectively, so how can the future affect yourself ? The conceptualisation of it can, because this is a construct that lives into your mind, a polystructural scheme that we cope to because it litterally helps to predict the future. But you're not affected by the future, you're affected by your perception of it, and the way you cope with your passed, how you intricate experience and expectation... if that makes sense
Forgetting about the future doesnt solution anything about anxiety when you have trauma, it just raise s**cide rates.",@TheTrippyCh0ng,UCvVF0XQOY_FyY2xe9UtpdQA,0,2025-07-30T02:42:50Z,False,True,UgzRjADZGHERcaWxY254AaABAg
