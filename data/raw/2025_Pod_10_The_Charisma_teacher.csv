Perhaps he should be having more empathy for the way his actions were perceived by the vast majority of the planet who witnessed it, regardless of what he may or may not have intended. If it was truly unintentional, an empathetic response can be made, explaining why it was misinterpreted, and what the intent was. That wasn’t his repones and as much as I appreciate you believing in the character of this billionaire and trusting his integrity, it’s so hard to believe a man who possesses what some say is genius level intelligence, and has vocalized support for the alt right party in Germany, had absolutely no idea what he did. Best of luck to your and your channel. I sincerely hope my beliefs on musk and the team standing behind our president when he took office are wrong. But I won’t consume content by anyone who attempts to rationalize what’s going on, especially to the point of suggesting we should have some “empathy” on a situation as sensitive as nazi salutes being performed on stage at a presidential inauguration that commenced with racially profiling and terrorizing the Latino communities in our nation. ✌🏻❤️",@ashleysimon4009,UC0GfejgqOrg91KRS1sXnazw,14,2025-02-03T18:47:03Z,False,True,UgzB4pChA3k6JgXrhRd4AaABAg

Being honest, it is not easy to keep up with Elon as his views are changing frequently and he unfortunately becomes more extreme. Recently for example he got involved in European elections supporting the AfD party in Germany, where some of it's prominent members have engaged in Holocaust trivialization and are close to neo nazi circles. I believe Elon does similar things in Italy as well. I agree with Charlie that Elon should have clarified that he didn't mean it, but he did not clarify that, which could also mean that he actually wanted to please some groups. He did the salute twice and I am sorry to say that, but it looks exactly as it ""supposed"" to look. To understand Elon better, I highly recommend the biography by Walter Isaacson whom Steven has actually interviewed in regards to this book. As much as I admire Elon for his succeses with Tesla and SpaceX (but not for his management style), I think he is a dangerous person while getting involved in politics and social media with the power and money he has.",@user-dm4bp1xf4v,UCoWG3ccLoINXBIqK3iZ34Sg,1,2025-02-07T10:37:18Z,False,True,UgzB4pChA3k6JgXrhRd4AaABAg

U have to work on it urself amd not all manipulation is bad. Some ppl use it bad. That's not the same thing. If ur friend Is depressed and you do nothing to help them y are choosing to stay out of it and theyll possibly spiral n unalive themselves.  If u put urself out there and go try to cheer em up, engage in conversation, get them out of the house,  that's manipulating their situation. For the better. It's giving them an opportunity to connect to you. Sometimes that connection as the enttiirrrreee thing is about, makes a world of difference to someone. Us? Why are we here watching this? Something either happened in ur life like this guy and u woke up n realized you need to make a change n learn some skills to improve urself.  That's self improvement started by, urself and ur own drive. Or, someone reached out to you woke you up and gave you the confidence you needed to work on urself and come out of ur shell. Every. Single thing.  Is a type of manipulation. A parent redirecting their child's bad behavior into a positive behavior. Manipulation. Ur partner or a boss or a parent, making u feel like shit putting u down chipping at your worth.  Negative manipulation, a parent changing that what was done to them and making confident and conscious decisions on how to better Parent. Or how to learn to run a  business. Even learning a basic skill is still manipulation of the brain. Some  people struggle to learn and have to find ways to trick their own brain to learn better, just another form of manipulation. The news, usually Negative manipulation. The people we surround ourselves with manipulate our emotions and how we think regularly. So. Manipulation isn't mad.

As a passionate artist who is socially awkward, I now understand how I come off as prey. I can't wait to try some of these tips out. I love this show, so thank you both.  But I gotta say, I was disappointed when things got political, and saw the obvious admiration you both have of Trump. He was rude in the debates, nasty, disgusting  and broke all the rules, and you admired this?!  Makes me pretty sad to hear that strong, intelligent compassionate,  men are so susceptible to the ""might is right"" theory. Trump is the worst thing that ever happened in the Country as far as spreading hate. ""Always attacking, interrupting, never admitting a mistake, and lying with bravado nearly everytime he opens his mouth are not good qualities.They don't make him appear strong to me. They make him appear petty, spoiled, nasty and out of control. Hitler was charismatic too. So was Manson. But to praise charisma alone, without more context is irresponsible, in my opinion.

And I don't agree that Democrats lose elections because they over react. The right over reacts in a much more obnoxious, lizard brained way, in my opinion. Trump just called the Muslim politian in New York a communist, for God's sake. So was Bernie Sanders according to Trump and Fox. And no one but Musk himself knows what his salute meant.

Educational Background

He studied Marketing, Management, and Commerce (University of Virginia) and earlier Spanish/Latin American Studies (American University).

No advanced training in psychology, counseling, or behavioral sciences. His expertise comes from self-study, personal experience, and applied experimentation, not from academia.

Where He Fits:
Humanist / Self-Help Genre

His brand is packaged like classic self-help: practical tips, inspirational framing, “you can transform your life” messaging.

Similar to Dale Carnegie (How to Win Friends and Influence People) or Tony Robbins—focused on personal change through practice, not peer-reviewed science.

Applied Communication Coach:
He’s more structured and example-driven than many “rah-rah” motivational gurus.

His charisma breakdowns (analyzing Obama, Elon Musk, Emma Watson, etc.) show he’s done deep observation and synthesis of communication styles.

Admirers note he avoids manipulative “pickup artist” vibes, staying closer to genuine human connection and confidence-building.

Substance Level:
Strengths: He does have a good grasp of social dynamics, body language, and storytelling, and presents them in accessible ways.

Limitations: His work doesn’t usually cite scientific research or rigorous studies the way a psychology professor like Amy Cuddy (body language) or Vanessa Van Edwards (Captivate) might.",@evenrabbits,UCKrO2X9ZxbpCwg9hMcm2Ecw,0,2025-08-17T17:41:14Z,False,True,UgzvxKszozSu5xFCJc94AaABAg

When the date was wrapping up, she asked me if we could see each other the next day. I told her I couldn't because I had something planned. But then while coming home I realized I could move things around, and sent her a message, she didn't react well. I wonder though, is it really NECESSARY to do all this power play?, or we could just avoid having to have this shitty games and find someone who doesn't play them? (even if it narrows it down). One of the things I hate is having to play this strategy games, of course if she didn't ask I wouldn't have asked for a second date the next day (even if I wanted). That much I 'can do', but taking it down further feels like too much, like being fake aka I'm interested in you but I'm going pretend that I'm not.

It's only seen in a positive light instead of the full extent. Like how charisma manipulates you into following those who are. How charisma is created and false to attract others and is not actually about authenticity. Like I get people like the trait. It is a trait about likableness or in actual means a means to attract others. Though it never feels like a genuine trait. Charisma is a tool. It can be used for power and to corrupt people. It swallows the mindless. It can be portrayed as a crowd pleaser to get people to do what they want. Hitler, Trump and Charles Manson are examples of charismatic people who have. Bussinesses do it to suck people in all the time. Trends are created from it and some of those trends are harmful. Charisma is often shown by leaders but doesn't mean the leader has leadership skills. Charisma is like a poison or a drug.

Recently my Dad had a 70th birthday garden party and there must have been 35-40 guests and it was red hot weather. He and his party were  worried people wouldn't interact with people they didn't know so I said leave that to me.  I set up two drinks tables as people came into the garden and put myself in charge of welcome drinks and ice breaking! Apparently the days after people had mentioned multiple times how sociable I was and the part itself was very successful. Like Charlie says, be the one to get things rolling!
One of my favourite little tips is to drop one of the first questions we all go to during introductions...""what do you do for a living?"".
Bear in mind MOST people don't love their jobs and they do them to earn money.
Replace it with: 
""So,  what excites you at the minute? If you didn't have a job...what would get you out of bed in the morning?

On Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said:

“The fundamental weakness of western civilization is empathy... They’re exploiting a bug in western civilization, which is the empathy response.”

This mirrors dangerous ideologies. Goebbels literally wrote in 1941: “Don’t be too fair,” warning against compassion that could “weaken” the nation. Musk’s logic, that caring about immigrants or the vulnerable is “civilizational suicide” follows that same fear-driven path.

Empathy for individuals isn’t weakness. But when you strip it down to only apply to your own group, while dehumanizing others, you’re not defending civilization — you’re repeating history",@mary-janefitzsimons9600,UC0XkKNqzJsoghnw3rFZ3u_w,0,2025-06-30T08:17:21Z,False,False,

And I also felt myself getting upset. Unfortunately, even with a lot of effort to keep myself from lashing out, and repeatedly saying that I was getting upset and that I'm very tired, I was not given any respect to get any space. I feel this can only work if the person's partner gives them equal respect. But regardless of what you say and how calm you try to be, repeated grilling would get someone to just loose it. But simply asked the person to leave, and I was tired and didn't want to discuss it anymore. I remaing calm but upset until they left. It was a very long path from me running away and lashing out to simply saying what I wanted. Thank you. I'll try harder to be in control.

It’s actually pretty offensive to call the left “disingenuous”, especially when a large part of your audience holds those views. There’s a huge amount of context behind Elon’s actions leading up to that gesture, and dismissing people’s valid opinions and concerns comes across as closed-minded.

Just making an attempt to break out of English and speak their language is something that helps break that barrier (even in Paris, outside the tourist traps).

Love the vulnerability and honesty, especially since his story sounds a lot like mine.  I really enjoyed this one overall that I had to comment.

I will also add, probably shouldn’t haha but I want to be honest because I feel like nobody is talking about it honestly.  Or at least honest with themselves.  When you shared your perspective on the Elon Musk salute, I can understand both sides reaction.  The excusing it on account of his awkwardness, because he is awkward.  Accusing him of Nazi ideology, coming from South Africa apartheid, his father being a racist, and his lack of empathy towards people which is evident on his treatment of his employees along with the thousands he’s laid off (which he celebrated with a chainsaw).  There’s a ton of tone deafness when it comes to him.  There’s autism, being on the spectrum can account for some of it, for sure.  But when I saw the salute, I saw it as a man who acted impulsively with his odd and often unfunny sense of humor.  He did a Nazi salute because he impulsively thought it was funny to do.  I’ve seen everyday people do stupid shit like this and instantly regret it.  He plays it off as well as he could.  There is a difference between just throwing up your hands, but the clear movement of it all, was not accidental.  None of us could accidentally do that 😂 that excuse makes me laugh.  But do I think he’s an actual nazi, no.  I just think he’s got some development issue of maturity and self awareness.

Something that came to my mind was the fact that languages matter so much.

I happened to study in a German school and the situation was exactly the same - “Sie” (with capital S) vs “du” … Later in life I learned English and it felt a much more  “friendly” language… (to me at least).

Frankly, there's something 'off' about people who consciously adopt behaviours to 'manipulate' the social responses of others.
This behaviour is rather like a computer hacker who manipulates code to gain  an outcome that is in their favour.

Someone who adopts positive behaviour as a natural spontaneous and 'non-strategic' interaction style, is occupying a different ('space'), from the 'social hacker'.

It wouldn't hurt to get better at spotting these different types and the nuances between them.

One is genuine, and 'natural', if you will.
The other is not.

One can be trusted, as generally acting from a place of honesty and genuine-good-will, with good intentions and an open heart.
The other should not be trusted, and their 'simulated' sincerity and pathos, should be politely disregarded.

This comes from observing certain individuals at work, who appear to be socially skillful and likeable, but who are in fact consumate 'social-hackers', and deeply pathalogical individuals. Unfortunately, these hackers also have , some troubling behaviours and attitudes towards certain others.

So after the lesson about how you can become more conscious of your behaviour and attitudes and how this affects your interaction with others, should come the lesson of how to apply this useful knowledge in a non-manipulative manner, that is also authentic to who you actually are, as opposed to how you would like others to perceive you.

Unfortunately the second learning is much harder than the first.",@jeromewillner1769,UCLyb5MHqK214PBZPrEyiLCg,2,2025-03-16T23:39:14Z,False,False,

You sharing your story in this way has given me courage to do the same and it means so much. I can see the veil lifting through these years from outer focus, to inner focus. Even after 20 years of therapy this has impacted me so much and I’ll never forget it. Dairy of a CEO podcast blows me away regularly but this one was personal and will stay in my heart forever.   Thank you Steven for advice on everything!!!… investing and parenting… everything… invaluable seriously!! ❤❤❤",@rachaelbertholino2849,UCdk-lmwGWQwc4_deVvDIk7A,18,2025-03-10T03:57:56Z,False,False,

It goes to show that we are our own worse critics. Maybe this is editing ""magic"" but at no point did i think Charlie's actions during the interview were ""bad"".

By all means, poor posture, face touching and circular responses are ""uncharismatic"" but what was not emphasized in Charlie's video is how vulnerable and authentic he was during this interview which completely makes up for that.

Sensitive/personal topics are brought up, and its relatable and endearing that Charlie lets his guard down in order to talk about them. In fact, id say if he followed his own ""advice"" it would be a net detriment as he is clearly being inauthentic in his demeanor while talking about himself. Its a barrier for the audience to be able to connect with him.

I think Charlie described it perfectly. ""You need to learn the rules in order to break the rules"", and this interview is a fantastic example of when breaking the rules and being purely yourself WORKS.",@lololol924,UCh79yKi-mhZUKuywmg6PfMA,42,2025-03-07T21:16:17Z,False,False,

But this episode, in more words, just told me I'd been doing the right thing all along. That open, vulnerable, over sharing and goofy part of me may have been my strength and destroying it may be setting me back. I've noticed a shift in less rewarding conversation, lack of connection. 
So, thank you for helping me realize that intuitively I was doing the right thing, that I didn't need to change. That these aren't terrible or immature qualities. ❤",@meigatronl.7813,UCoEK3uGAYXHfcqi0NVRzaaA,7,2025-03-04T17:55:17Z,False,False,

I'm not especially beautiful and never styles myself to look feminine and I'm also brainy in a way that I've been told can people make afraid of me. But young men still hit on me based on one interested look I might've given them because I'm generally interested in people. It never were men that were potential partners for me and I quickly started feeling like a piece of meat since it felt like they weren't interested in connecting with me as a human but only in my body and bedding me as fast as possible. For a natural introvert, that's not the best experience for learning to connect more with people. Thankfully, that subsides when you get older and have been in a happy relationship for a decade or two. Seems that you automatically send the message that you're not available - or men around your age mostly aren't looking for a s..ual partner anymore.😄",@SuBeKuTah,UCAA_FVcPespZxWMaQww5QSA,0,2025-03-02T14:10:34Z,False,False,

By allowing yourself to be who you are, you allow others to do the same. That being said some people (mostly manifesters in human design) have a close and repelling energy that can appear rude. It's good to know that by informing people that are impacted by your actions and decisions, you will be more supported and better understood (less see as rude) by others. For the rest, if people take too personally that's their gig 😉",@rememberhuman,UCNVG0Ri6SsHesQVC_06lwPA,1,2025-02-27T10:38:05Z,False,False,

He used the words and said things that the average person does; despite his real thoughts and actions are quite the opposite. 

People like to think they put morality, fairness, honestly, etc. above all else.  We lie to ourselves. We're animals.  Our crock brain kicks in.  We love and yearn for bad shit to happen.  We are attracted to it.  Look at sports, action movies, hunting, we idolize companies and Billionaires that treat people like shit, etc. Sure we say we're for peace, love, respect, and fairness.  But when push comes to shove, we will be and do the most horrific things to get ahead and for self preservation.

The segment on ""I'm Sorry"" is less of a reflection of the news media today and more of a reflection of cancel culture where once someone is offended by anything, it doesn't matter if you say sorry, donate money, you're f#@king done.

Both gents did reference before and after that after time when things are looked back on, you have a different perspective and view things in a different light.

Trump and Elon don't say sorry just because it's viewed as weakness and the media will do a ""Gotcha Moment"", both are narcissists.  Sorry isn't in their toolbox, but lying and manipulation is to get what they want.",@mckibbinjoe,UC_AW_ZynmO_7wYaYHxCEMbg,0,2025-02-26T11:34:00Z,False,False,

One example: the other day i went to cinema and had to wait for my friend. There was no one there, just me and the vendor. So i was just bored and asked the vendor what movies he would recommend. So we start talking and my friend arrived and i made a joke with the guy automatically that there is no ticket left for her. Guess what happened?

even my education are secondary to my ability to make people feel a certain way..."" but if you account for the power of ""authenticity"" in charismatic mindsets #2, 3, 4, and perhaps 5, and 6, too – it's more about YOU/US feeling a certain way, vs. MAKING someone else feel a certain way. That authenticity resonates at such a high frequency, associated with Love/Happiness, that it magnetizes people up vs. manipulating people down. NPD's/psychopaths manipulate. Authentic people inspire. Both can emanate charisma, which may look the same at first glance.

Charlie keep sharing the message of how your adult self had judged your younger self subconsciously and unaware the side effect of that caused you to feel shame, reducing you self worth and holding onto other emotional wounds throughout the years.

Allowing your adult self to nurture your younger self,  sitting with them so they feel heard, seen and loving them unconditionally rather than blaming and judging them is the way to heal our past trauma and heal. Honestly my heart is full hearing this story..

Well done on sharing your journey so open and vulnerably what a beautiful soul you are Charlie. Thank you

This can appear like charisma at first, but gets old soon after. Especially those who truly embody all 5 types, show these traits from a very different inner state, which the excessively needy and compulsive ego won't allow for.

He might not have meant to do a salute but every neo nazi is going to feel emboldened by him not explaining himself and no one in the GOP holding him to account till he does.

The environment we exist in now is one where people who brutally attacked cops just doing their jobs on Jan 6th have been pardoned by the man they were attacking for.

The threat of violence against people who don’t toe the line is a key tenant of fascism and not to be underestimated.

I’m in Australia and there is jail time for throwing the Nazi Salute, as there should be. It’s intrinsically linked to genocide. Undoubtedly a call to violence and it should be treated as such. 

If Elon says it wasn’t meant that way fine, but allowing him to brush it off is a dangerous precedent to set.",@Peregrine86,UC5EEP2iJqnwGQLzAtBcV14Q,3,2025-02-14T05:07:09Z,False,False,

The probable cause of this is Ive been hurt, let down and double crossed by some very bad people. My coping mechanism is to shut people out my life as I’m happier without them. 
Interestingly, I don’t think I lack confidence, in fact it’s the complete opposite, I’m 100% confident in who I am, as I feel I don’t need other people’s approval.
I’ve made every effort to turn this around by starting conversations with people by asking about their life, what they do, take an interest in their hobby and ask how was their weekend… and in return?… Nothing. The conversation then stops dead as they don’t ask back and show zero interest in me. It always seems I’m starting the conversation and not them.
Me: “How was your weekend”

That said, there are also environments where charisma doesn't cut it, or if it is beneficial, it's the interactive tip of an enormous iceberg of competence and knowledge. I'm a scientist and in my time have met charismatic bullshiters and fairly plain and ordinary innovators. That second type is worth a mention because they quietly keep important aspects of our discplines in check and grounded in reality.
One of the biggest problems with personality politics in the US is the smokescreen it creates, not enabling us to get clear on facts.
Trump only knows competing, namecalling and overpowering as tools to get what he wants done. That is to my mind short sighted and self-interested.

The fact that people associate that with a Nazi salute doesn't come out of the blue and only by seeing that action, which he did twice to make sure people could see him, but by the history and the actions of Elon Musk himself. He is associating himself by taking part in manifestations in Germany with the Afd, by removing the proof that the terrorist, the one that rode his car killing many people in a public german festivity, was a Nazi, by having interview depicting hitler as a left leaning guy and contestualizing correctly what he has done. Even if you consider the fact that he was trolling, that proves even more that he was doing a Nazi salute because what would be more triggering than that. I'm not even saying he fully agrees with that ideology but a person who right now his the richest man in the world, who's gutting any form of government by his own without any constituional authority needs to be treated as seriously as possible. The fact that both of you are more concerned with the reaction of others rather than the action of one of the most powerful man who ever existed who feels above all consequences and is free to do whatever he likes tells a lot about your character.

I personally don't like using alcohol or drugs because I want the healing to come from within me naturally and spiritually. I am sharing this because I want others to know that you can get there without chemical therapies. Psychedelics may work for some people. For me, prayer, fasting, asking for answers and expecting an outcome has worked. It is a lifelong journey. Obviously, by listening to podcasts like this , I am still learning . Faith in the process and not giving up is important.  Living in truth and authenticity makes a huge difference in your life. Understanding that I'm doing the best that I can takes a lot of pressure off of me.",@marijar8638,UCdWhgcMwp8xEBkg1HTCw_Vg,3,2025-02-09T15:28:28Z,False,False,

In the country where the salute is coming from there is no doubt about what this was. He also attended several election events of the far right party and openly praised them, called for them to be elected and pushes their content and narratives with fake accounts on X. 
His family has a nazi background. 
But the thing is, with Musk it is even worse than with Hitler, who was an ideologist. Musk doesn’t believe in anything but that which gives him more power. In Europe these are all the far right parties- which want to dismantle the European Union and the European laws that protect us from Musks ruthless power grabs and treatment of employees.

I agree that if musk said that wasn't my intention or sorry, that would have gone a long way, but not for some. Some people it doesn't matter what you do.

You have such a beautiful, magnetic presence and I’m inspired by your insights into what makes people tick . 
I am 30 this year and sometimes feel a bit behind with my conversation skills. Doesn’t help that I am slightly weird and misunderstood half the time 😂. 
I’m really loving who I’m growing into, it just feels isolating and depleting not having a group of people around, despite all efforts to try and do different things and get myself out of my bubble.

I'm now 32 living in the UK and finally found the courage to reach out for help, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel which I haven't seen for years. The motivation I got came from listening to people like you and your guests which gave me strengths to fight back and hope to finally find the right path to express my creativity.

He did something I’d consider much worse than Aziz, but because he took full accountability in his apology, I still engage with his work. Aziz, on the other hand, never actually fully apologized. I wasn’t terribly offended by what he did, and while I didn’t love his initial complaints about liberals playing “Progressive Candy Crush” on Twitter, my real eye roll came at what I perceived as an not genuine, half-apology. He essentially said, “I’m sorry you feel that way. I’m embarrassed.” So to your point, if you’re not going to offer a real apology, then stay mum.

His participation in Trump's administration shows an alignment with race-baiting and acceptance of the support from hate groups. The Trump administration including ELON have attacked cultural groups, celebrations, benefits, etc. with the knowledge that the majority in the US is WHITE MEN and the changes they are making will benefit WHITE MEN.  There is data that supports this and watching ELON's moves, meeting with Germany and cancelling all non-white clubs, funds, etc. after his on stage salute reconfirms previous held views about him. ELON may have been born in Africa but he is an Anglo-European man who supports treating other groups poorly...INCLUDING but NOT LIMITED TO racial, religious and class groups.

Women get lots of attention from men/ boys, and most of it is actually boys just ""trying to get to second base"". They will *act* like her friend, always hoping for more, and when they don't get it, they complain about being Friendzoned. How much does it suck for the girl/ woman to realize at such a young age that so many people she thought were her friends were not actually her friends at all, and were just trying to get laid? They learn early to suspect everyone, be slow to trust. They don't like you for you, they are just looking for a fix.

Once i had a job interview, on my resume i had included my former manager and coworker as references. I didn't get the job even though i was highly over qualified, over experienced and I had great response after my interview session was over. A week later I heard from someone else, they both on purpose gave mediocre references so i wouldn't get the job because they deep down hated me and ceased the opportunity to take aim 😔 seems I'm not good at reading people.",@myjourneytotruth,UCBGSyczPhoIy1FVBP8PdWhQ,0,2025-02-05T14:24:04Z,False,False,

Charlie, the end touched me so much. I have a license in hypnotherapy with RTT and we walk people through that love you talked about after the pain they went through. Every time there is abuse they think it’s their fault. 
It never was, you were a beautiful perfect boy and someone took advantage of your innocence, your trust.  We do this part of reparenting the younger self and you say envisioned this little you, “I am so proud of you. You’re a delight, you were a wonderful little kid. There is nothing wrong with you. It was never your fault. You are so loved, and fun and creative.
I love hanging out with you. I don’t mind if you’re awkward or insecure or scared sometimes.
I’m going to have time for you now. I’m going to sit with you and listen to you and care about how you feel. You bring the fun and joy and being in the moment and I’ll bring the wisdom and stand up for you and protect you. “

I hope you bring these words in your meditations/mushroom trips and daily. It’s so powerful to change the script and the beliefs you once had were just thoughts, they’re not true.

I’m so proud of you that you go through mushroom trips with the intention to heal that pain. And it’s so true that underneath the pain of what you believed about yourself is this incredible love from The Universe and your higher self that has always been guiding you.

Charlie you got into the path I know I will be taking. You are such a gift to this World. Steven, thank you again for bringing on amazing guests and being real and going to the deeper questions. Love your show ❤",@practical.emotions,UCv8V3xlgc8DBgTIoLcLoyhg,0,2025-02-05T01:32:33Z,False,False,

But that would have made your work of art contrived.

Integrity means selecting panelists as a matter of artistic composition, and you choose the ones that are right for your work of art.

If what you have in mind is a work of art that involves someone of a particular gender or race or whatever, that's fine.

But you can't just say generally that it benefits the viewers for you to include someone female. Otherwise, you were wrong to criticize your advisor who suggested it this time.

Lex Friedman has a podcast bigger than yours, and he had a panel that included Finkelstein and Morris and Destiny and some other dude. All dudes. Because that fit the work of art he had in mind for that episode.

If you include a woman because that fits your artistic vision for the episode, it's art.

But if you include a woman just for its own sake, that means the whole thing is contrived.

Obviously it goes without saying that if the panelists turn out to be women and then you try to include a man just for the sake of including a man, that's also contrived.

(This channel is still way too aggressive with teasers. If we want to take the bait, we have to take a chance that maybe whatever gem of information you are teasing us with is actually just a piece of crap that is not going to help at all. So I feel manipulated, and I'm resentful regardless of whether I get something valuable or not.)",@noahghost4476,UCCwsKkqBMjHssjssJ8UEqzw,0,2025-02-04T21:52:24Z,False,False,

This insightful exploration delves into the profound impact of charisma as a catalyst for success, as evidenced through the expertise of Charlie Hooper, who has emerged as a prominent figure in understanding and teaching charisma. The dialogue reveals that charisma, often underestimated in its potential to shape lives, plays a crucial role in influencing others, forging meaningful connections, and enhancing communication skills. The narrative draws on examples such as Donald Trump's ascent to the presidency, showcasing how charisma can triumph over conventional qualifications.

Charlie's personal narrative unfolds a transformation from a state of social invisibility and confidence challenges, rooted in past traumas, to mastering charisma as a pivotal skill. The text underscores that charisma is not an innate trait but a learnable and transformative ability capable of redirecting one's life path. It introduces practical strategies like discerning prey versus predator movements to make impactful first impressions, cultivating traits that naturally attract others, and adopting six specific mindsets oriented toward charismatic success.

A significant theme is the powerful influence of first impressions, where even minor actions can alter perceptions drastically. Charlie advises against merely being interested in others, advocating instead for a balanced approach that projects fun, trust, and respect, prior to showing interest. Mastery of non-verbal communication, including confident body language and slow, intentional movements, is highlighted as essential for establishing an aura of higher status and safety.

The conversation shifts towards applying charisma strategically in professional environments, such as during job interviews, where preparation combined with engaging storytelling can significantly boost appeal. Moreover, the narrative cautions against the ethical implications of charismatic influence, emphasizing the necessity of upholding honesty and integrity. It warns of the risks attached to prioritizing reputation over character, citing public figures like Elon Musk as cautionary examples.

In essence, the dialogue portrays charisma not as a tool for manipulation, but as a means of fostering genuine relationships, nurturing self-confidence, and inspiring those around us. By embracing these principles, individuals are empowered to cultivate deeper connections and achieve heightened success across both personal and professional spheres.

This engaging exploration examines the nuanced dynamics of human interaction, focusing on the interplay between authenticity and charisma in both social and professional realms. At its core is the principle of prioritizing genuine self-expression over manipulative tactics. By cultivating a fulfilling life filled with diverse activities, individuals naturally enhance their charisma, becoming more attractive and engaging without resorting to deception. The narrative critiques common communication missteps, such as interpreting ambiguous signals negatively or monopolizing dialogue, which can lead to social disconnection. Brie Larson's media interactions are presented as cautionary examples, underscoring the value of maintaining a welcoming and open demeanor.

Leadership communication techniques are dissected, emphasizing the strategic use of silence, minimal filler words, and dynamic body language to captivate audiences. Embracing one's personal space and exuding a confident presence are highlighted as key strategies for appearing more engaging and influential.

The text also delves into themes of self-confidence and perception, advocating for an egalitarian view of all individuals, regardless of societal status. Shifting one's mindset in this way fosters genuine relationships and encourages authentic self-expression.

A poignant personal narrative unfolds, detailing the speaker's recovery from traumatic childhood sexual abuse. This journey illustrates the transformative power of confronting deep-seated shame and cultivating self-compassion. Through experiences like psychedelic journeys, the speaker reconnects with their true self, fostering a sense of self-love and compassion. This personal transformation fuels their mission to help others achieve similar breakthroughs.

The discourse concludes by reinforcing the value of authenticity in fostering meaningful connections. Rather than persuading others to engage, it encourages creating inviting environments where genuine relationships can develop organically. The speaker's dedication to disseminating these insights through various channels is highlighted, offering hope and guidance to those seeking personal growth and empowerment on their journey of self-discovery.

Also, I’m sorry people get so defensive about these behavioural dos and donts, the thing is that it’s not criticism and they should not take it as such… it’s just human nature… that said, though people can learn the behaviour, I think without an internal change, it won’t come out as genuine and others will “smell”that, but action is what very often changes our beliefs in ourselves and if we try it, it might change something in our lives for the better… give it a shot! 😉",@hems8359,UCrOWp7goMlk4C-Tv1JRIwxA,0,2025-02-04T17:03:20Z,False,False,

My mother could not bear to touch me but adored my sister with an obsession. I was taught that my worth was always less than others to whom I should be respectful. Boarding school from the age of five. I was deeply religious until I was told to stop talking about it as I was embarrassing them. I needed interaction and guidance to deal with the world. I do forgive them … it is so correct to say “learn to love yourself.” For whatever reason you were put on this earth…. you cannot become that person until you learn to love yourself.,@blakeward5710,UCRH4mDNMvjFvgtLpsIMnwfg,14,2025-02-04T16:53:03Z,False,False,

I hate small talk, however it does serve a very useful purpose. It sends signals to the person you are talking to that you are happy just to engage with them, it doesn't have to be about any real sharing of information which is what deeper conversations tend to be. People who happily engage in small talk with you are happy just to talk to you. It's kind of like a dance, being really good at small talk requires a lot of advanced social techniques, thus by engaging in small talk you are showing off just how good you are at socializing. It's almost a form of peacocking. Plus, a huge percentage of communication is non-verbal. When the words are small the body language becomes emphasized.",@Greg-xs5py,UCD_SPzkuMVwfq9LE_M6xMKA,0,2025-02-04T16:49:25Z,False,False,

They say it's ok to do white lies but I would say that if someone can do small lies then I couldnt fully trust them to not do bigger lies. They lie to other friends or family with white lies but it's still just lies, if you can lie to them them you can lie to me. Who can we trust anymore.
I even felt bad when my parent bought me an apple tree for me birthday, they wanted to surprise me and hid it round the back of the house. I saw them pass the window with them tree. So when  dad got me to stand in the garden next to it but cleverly positioning me so I wouldnt notice it, and asked me to turn around whilst filming to catch my surprise. I felt bad afterwards and still do to this day because in the moment, I did act surprised and they were delighted and laughed. But i felt so guilty. I felt I deceived them, which is like lying. So i feel i as good aside to them. 
I'm embarrassed to say anything now and they have it forever on recording. But I may come clean because it eats at me. This sounds silly and most people wont understand and say it wasnt lying. But I've always hated lying since a child. And if it dont feel right, then maybe it's because for me, it isnt. 

Lying is so horrible because so many do it so easily and dont feel bad. I really struggle to trust anyone anymore and feel so alone in how I think. But then hearing 2 men speaking about it and how you have similar ways of thinking. There is hope that there are others lol.

Given that I've accomplished understanding the quantum world through thought experiments, so I got there pretty much by myself, the gap in worldview will force me to view others as tools, which is a death of it's own, instead of co-humans to build a better future with, together. The gap is enough that we might as well be living in different universes and in a way it would be the truth. Suddenly I get the people like Steve Jobs, or I feel like it. Does it have to be that way?

Maybe for those of us who are capable of it need to view it that way to bring that better future into being. Is it possible people want to be used instead of worked with?

It was not possible to do this living with so many people as I did not have the space, but so glad I did it because of the person I become...very confident around people as always with people.  You don' t need to be taught this...we are social animal but so many people live alone and don't have any community or neighbour  looking out for them and it is very sad that they won't have this experience, and I think this lead to mental health issue with not mixing with others and being alone. I don't believe he is thinking of this in his talk he is just trying to give you advice to do this or that but until you mix and be social and live with many people you will not learn properly the skills needed to be totally social in society.

(a different chapter altogether) and all that prop&costume  is no longer of any use.  people are not idiots. they can sense that this or that ""alpha male"" is just ticking off the check list: here's bit of JP, there a smattering of BO, or a sprinkling of TR.  T.Robbins taken out of the American he-man, saviour complex context becomes just another maximally weird twitchy cartoon character. an assault butter knife with a tactical grip. you simply don't get to be ""all that"" just because you want to.  and mama wants a pony.",@agatadusko9646,UCVvJCN5QR3XAlqKPBYMS0kA,1,2025-02-03T23:29:55Z,False,False,

So I was terribly put off by the last show where you had the panel of men discussing important current events etc and left a comment regarding the fact that there was not a female expert. It left me with a slightly negative feeling towards you that you had invited the guys in to talk about what's wrong with the world. It's not about equity and I'm glad you realised it. I think what was lacking was more about the three men being similarly so opinionated. The tone just got too toxic for me. I'd be similarly revolted if they'd been three females say.... Mel Robbins types. The balance was out but could have been helped with a female on board simply because we all already exist in a world where men sit in leadership preaching the narratives they believe in and so it was almost essential to have a female in this case. One of the things I like about your channel is the discussion aspect...eg. Charlie asking you questions at times. This is a trademark aspect of Diary of a CEO...as I'm sure you're aware of...Your own little insights and revelations make it very human. The last episode felt somewhat of a rant and I actually clicked on this one thinking...okay...maybe one more.

As if we Trump voters were wowed by his brilliant statesmanship and witty repartes? Not by a long shot! I will admit that listening to some lengthy interviews, including Joe Rogan's, allowed me to see him as more a person and allowed him to better explain himself and his goals. He sounded so capable and wise...not something I have ever thought listening to his speeches. Besides how very, very unlikable Kamala is and how completely witless and fake she appears to be, there's how harebrained wrong most of her party and policies are. THAT, that is why people voted for Donald Trump. For economic recovery. For border security without sacrificing personal liberty. For being able to negotiate with the rest of the world and advocate for us, the United States. For sanity when it comes to gender associated surgeries and treatment with regards to age appropriateness and who's footing the bill for whom. For private space protection, and sports/scholarship access for those people born with female bodies - you know, boobs, less muscle mass compared to males, and higher comparitive levels of neuroticism, otherwise and throughout history known without confusion or contraversy, as women.
Those are just some of the reasons I voted for Trump.

to think our way into connection rather than be heartfelt and real.

I’ll be honest the world is very lonely cause no one really cares about you you’re going to realize people only really care about themselves . When someone asks how you are , really they wanna talk about themselves.  It’s gross. That’s why I personally have no friends cause it’s just too much for me like I don’t care to be interested in other people like I actually am not interested in anyone . But I pretend to be to make money",@b-rare,UCBkxTA-z07t8A1TsW-mBR6Q,8,2025-02-03T16:11:36Z,False,False,

But, that's not something we average voters have any real information about. Now, one might say in his own party it could have contributed in being the nominee (but even then, I think that has more to do with the below ZERO levels of charisma his republican peers had), but not the election/presidential vote itself, because there were too many people who truly did not like him (his approaches to communication) in the least bit who were responsible for his win and some who didnt even truly ""trust"" him, yet trusted democrats even less this cycle . I myself only recently started to ""like"" him. Prior to that, I simply appreciated having another option outside of what democrats were offering. The level of fakeness in the democrat party is astounding. I can't believe how blind I was to it as a child. You might even say it's the democrats who are typically more charismatic.

Life can flip your head around and you will land on your tail. *my current experience, unfortunately.  Now hindsight self educating my lessons so I don't waste the opportunity from such expensive hardknox curriculum. 

My pieces are not even close to picked up yet and more pain or suffering is Forcast just to be honest.  

Choose your friends wisely and carefully determine if you should or should not stick your dick in every willing participant, ok ok. 

Now I will say what is randomly on my mind. 


Perhaps the flatearth society is really a satirical website and obvious to anyone who dives deep into the flat earth theory.  
Which is not a conspiracy either unless it really is flat then who benefits from the lie * I'm not a flat earth believing person but after years of searching for every single point of contention from both camps and Grey area contemplating each point of view I believe both camps are absolutely 💯 right 
It's my understanding that reality is subjective and also experimental evidence is ALWAYS effected by the observer.  Light is a partical and a wave, after all both simultaneously or separately. 

Also the shape doesn't have a impact on how my dairy life is managed.  

However many Conspiracy issues are so hard to believe because they are horrible crimes against humanity.  And we have to recognize it is uncomfortable to accept that if true. 
 when the facts often happen to validate the crazy theorists claims in due time,  give notice. 

The crazy people who are seeing and speaking the uncomfortable truth before the pacified majority is woken up... are intelligent people. SOCIALLY RETARDED, I am self proclaiming, must not help the world understanding the concepts in timely manner. 

I believe it was Einstein, or not, that coined the expression about how smart people look like crazy people to all the dumb people.  

We all have points of view and experiences to share and that is beautiful. 

We all have opinions and that is not as beautiful when improperly formed and spoke with conviction and closed mindset. 

The more you understand your field of study or professional career... the more you recognize that complacency in learning and new perspectives can be dangerous or render obsolescence.

A lot of times ppl want to have deep intellectual dialogues but most ppl don’t care about that cause just like you they wanna stay in a “happy go lucky” type of mood and most intellectual conversations will leave you completely in the opposite direction so ppl make small talk just to not only avoid it but to also not waste your time. Cause let’s be frank most ppl don’t wanna have dialogues about serious and potentially very problematic things that’s happening in the world. So to save face ppl just do small talk. 
Keep in mind these intellectual dialogues can lead into politics, religion, way of living, nutrition, psychology, the state of the world and etc.. 
who wants to talk about that all day every day??
Ppl like me want to but I know there are ppl who can’t stay and talk about these for more than two mins without their state of happiness being ruined by something serious in our reality. 
So what’s the best next thing???
Small talk.

Weather positive or negative or confident or scared. However, it will never apply to everyone.... Even if it applied to 90% of mankind you would still have several billion people that it doesn't apply to.....
      However, for the majority, people  generally learn how to read behaviors by reading what society says is Normal.... So if you know how to fit into that normal or how to be better than that normal, you can achieve popularity and you can also get further in the business world. Like for instance he's were talking about confidence up here. No matter how good your skills are, if you make your boss feel like you are incompetent by your behavior and give him an anxiety attack every time he brings a task to your desk he's going to perceive you to be under qualified for your position because you have no confidence in your skills.

The body language mirroring your insecurities, only turning ur head instead of the body is so true. 2. You having the same thoughts as everyone else is also so true but aslo bittersweet when i think of all the chansen of connection ive missed trough the years. 3. Leaving bread crums in small talk is also so true and i feel like we all kinda do that subcounciusly when we want to talk about something. 
All in all. I love improving myself and being aware of these ""transactions"" we do between eachother and it is so interesting and challenging to think deeper about it and actually experiment with it in real life.

1. The Prey vs. Predator Movement (Body Language)
	•	Confident individuals move slowly and deliberately, while insecure people tend to be fidgety and darting in their movements.
	•	This “prey-like” behavior signals low confidence, whereas “predator-like” movements suggest authority and control.
	•	Key Tip: Slow down your movements to appear more confident and high-status.

2. First Impressions and the FTR Formula
	•	Fun, Trust, and Respect (FTR) is the formula for making great first impressions.
	•	Fun: Bring positive energy into conversations.
	•	Trust: Avoid trying too hard to impress.
	•	Respect: Establish yourself as an authority in a natural way.

3. The Power of “One More Sentence”
	•	Most people cut conversations short due to social anxiety.
	•	Challenge yourself to add just one more sentence in social interactions (e.g., chatting with a cashier, colleague, or stranger).
	•	Over time, this builds confidence and conversational ease.

4. Flirting with the World (Playfulness)
	•	Light-hearted playfulness makes interactions memorable and engaging.
	•	Example: Instead of just answering “What floor?” in an elevator, jokingly say, “I’m casing the joint for a robbery!”
	•	Key Tip: Being playful can make people feel comfortable around you.

5. Social Status and Presence
	•	Leaders and confident individuals own the space they are in.
	•	People who feel insecure often avoid being “caught looking” at others, while high-status individuals confidently turn their full attention toward others.
	•	Key Tip: Be deliberate with your eye contact and body orientation.

Criticism & Counterpoints

1. Over-Simplicity of Social Dynamics
	•	The prey vs. predator analogy may oversimplify social interactions. Not everyone who moves quickly lacks confidence, and not everyone who moves slowly commands respect.
	•	Critique: Confidence is more than just body language; it also involves verbal skills, emotional intelligence, and context.

2. Risk of Overconfidence and Fake Persona
	•	Some viewers might interpret these techniques as manipulative rather than authentic.
	•	Critique: True charisma should come from authenticity, not memorized techniques. If forced, it can appear unnatural or even off-putting.

3. Social & Cultural Variability
	•	What works in Western social settings may not necessarily work in Asian, Middle Eastern, or other cultural environments where humility and subtlety are valued over overt confidence.
	•	Critique: Social norms vary widely, and one-size-fits-all approaches may not be universally effective.

4. Focus on Outward Perception vs. Internal Growth
	•	The techniques are focused on how others perceive you rather than genuinely improving self-worth.
	•	Critique: Instead of faking confidence, people should work on inner growth, self-acceptance, and meaningful relationships.

Is There Merit in This Advice?
	•	Yes, if used correctly.
	•	Many of these techniques do work—adjusting body language, adding playfulness, and improving first impressions can enhance social confidence.
	•	However, genuine confidence comes from self-acceptance, competence, and personal growth, not just outward tricks.
	•	The best takeaway? Adopt what feels natural and aligns with your personality rather than blindly following social hacks.

Final Thoughts

This video provides solid practical tips but should be taken with nuance. Confidence is more than a set of behaviors—it’s an internal state that reflects outwardly. While improving social skills is valuable, authenticity and self-awareness should remain at the core of any approach to personal growth.",@KrisjanisBerzins,UCIVDn7fwXruSNhRBhAICO0g,0,2025-02-03T12:26:46Z,False,False,

Mindset in an interview or a social situation etc.
1) Body first (expansive body language, deep breaths as this positively affects your own mind)
2) Consider concentrating on making them feel good! (Jordan Peterson talks a lot about this as it alleviates any anxiety in yourself and leaves them with a good feeling of you too)
3) Look at it as it’s just a minor chat etc, whatever happens will be a good thing, I’ll live, and make it win win.
Then in the interaction:
1) Humanise it, take leadership and go there first with a tease, something funny, a compliment, something absurd etc, anything positive, but calibrated to the situation. (don’t compliment a superior in an interview as it is arrogant)
2)Then when being open and sharing your passions or purpose or values or moving the conversation to feelings etc, leave it open for the other to jump in so can connect deeper.
3) Be interested in them! Even validate there responses, as in what Charlie said about having standards and boundaries etc.",@Colinagill,UCefefDD6qu_b_T9szhjFG5A,1,2025-02-03T11:59:49Z,False,False,

I am a visual artist, stone carving, bronze sculptures, paintings, etc.  I grew up with an artist mother, but saw how difficult it was to earn money from art. Anyway, when I finally realized that I am an artist, I had a difficult time saying so to people.  Why?  Because I had it in my head that artists are cool people. I am not cool; I am just myself, nothing exotic or fun.  However, I made a goal to “coppa feel on a real Michelangelo marble before I turned 40.”  I did. But in the process, I did what your guest did, experimenting while abroad.  I told myself that no one in Italy knows me, so I can be whatever I want to be.  What started out as an experiment gave me the habit of saying, “I am an artist” without feeling full of myself or false.  My family would not likely held me back on this change.  But it is said that if you want to diet, have a problem and need to give up alcohol, or want to make any change for yourself, those around you often do not want you to change because it “forces” a change in them.  At the very least on how they relate to you, but more often because without any pressure from the changer, the other decides he does not want to go on that diet with you, or refuse a drink at a party, or work harder, etc.  They resist change in themselves and thus try to pull you back to your former dynamic.

I agree that there was a quick, knee-jerk reaction to the whole thing, but this weird revisionist history is wild and irresponsible.
For starters, you are defending Elon by trying to create a level of context and empathy, and that’s entirely fair to do. However, Elon has a well-documented history of a) of lying b) pushing false and racist narratives. I have my own theories about this, but facts are what they are.
The issue, though, is you’re contextualizing his behavior as “Well, that’s Elon” and disregarding how he unbanned known neo-nazis on his platform and allows that element to run rampant.
The primary problematic part to this, and crux of my diatribe, is you’re speaking of empathy… but don’t seem to provide that particular thought process to the folks who see Elon’s particular history, his patterns, and who he aligns with and conclude that he was lowkey trying to get away with a salute. It’s a very one-sided approach from someone who positions themself to be objective. 

Edit: Also, as a fun fact, “the left” wasn’t the only group that thought that salute was there to promote neo-nazis… neo-nazis also believed he’s on their team. So the clarification was necessary not only to address the concerns, but to draw the line on where he stands to denounce a hate group. He didn’t do that.

“Clearly you must be new to the Internet.”— Nope.
“If he went out of his way to say…”— For starters, that’s not how anything works. Your logic here fails immensely because the people who already thought Musk was a nazi (the “quadruple down” as you call it) already would believe that regardless. My point about the optics is the people who did not know now have questions, not because what he did, but how he chose to respond and his past behavior. Mind you, Elon said nothing— his simps made the excuses for him.

“Other politicians…”— So you must be new to the internet because we can all use Google and verify this is patently false. Those “poses” were stills taken from a bigger gesture. It’s blatantly dishonest to compare stills when we saw the overall gesture, and Elon’s response.

Feel free to engage, but take that bad faith nonsense somewhere else.

Edit: Lastly, my point had really nothing to do with Elon except context. The fact that you read my criticism of their treatment here as rallying cry to defend Elon says a lot about you.",@bobbyray5165,UCD7ORGx1gnAD4bfkJB7nPBA,0,2025-02-09T15:15:52Z,False,True,UgykmqRV9h77VeIeHJt4AaABAg

Here are some simple tips:

Enthusiasm in Responses

- Be More Than ""Fine"": When someone asks how you are doing, instead of saying ""fine"" or ""good,"" give a more enthusiastic response like ""fantastic,"" ""wonderful,"" or ""better than good."" This small change can set a lively tone for the conversation.

Use Humor

- Light Jokes: Incorporate light-hearted jokes or playful comments into the conversation. This doesn't mean you have to be a comedian, but small, situational jokes can make interactions more enjoyable.
- Playful Remarks: When asked routine questions, respond with a playful twist. For example, if someone asks what floor you're going to in an elevator, you might say, ""I'm just casing the joint.""

Body Language

- Smile and Maintain Eye Contact: A warm smile and good eye contact can make your interactions feel more welcoming and engaging.
- Open Gestures: Use open and inviting body language to convey friendliness and approachability.

Ask Engaging Questions

- Beyond the Usual: Instead of typical small talk, ask questions that allow the other person to share something interesting or fun about themselves. For instance, ""What's the most exciting thing you've done this week?""

These strategies help create an atmosphere of fun and engagement without requiring complex social maneuvers.",@MrNiaman,UCGlu7T9b-jFHFA-JavBVWsw,0,2025-02-03T10:28:48Z,False,False,

Sure, being liked gives you temporary validation, sense of acceptance, and it can open some doors in life/career, but ultimately, you connect with the wrong people, lose sense of who you truly are, and implementing behaviours that are not natural to you gets really mentally exhausting.

So for the most part I enjoy back and forth talking where we're both sharing I think most people would like this but when one is the only one sharing and the other isn't sharing on a regular basis I have to wonder and I've experienced this what kind of friend is this person and what kind of friend am I engaging each other is a 2 way street and if there's only one talking about themselves and not engaging the other and the other isn't engaging but just listening well then sadly this really isn't an engaging conversation😔

Both people really need to think about the interactions they're having with each other and think about is this really a fulfilling relationship I have a friend like this and it bothers me so I don't call her at times because I really think it isn't healthy if you're bothered by it
maybe talk to her about it but sometimes taking a break or setting some boundaries for yourself might kick start the relationship in a different direction🥴

I think that talking about this may be awkward and strange but if you need to get it off your chest why not say something what's there to lose in the end it's all about communication 🫶🏼

Listen sometimes in LIFE we need a friend to vent to and they do too so if you BOTH can be on board with engaging each other and having conversations that go back and forth then this it what a friendship is ALL about at the END of the DAY🌈",@sunnyday8628,UCqyZIW_pk6h8Y69pu3CnEEQ,1,2025-03-07T12:30:10Z,False,True,UgwcjQiYEPhBcBVk-814AaABAg

	1.	Genuine Confidence: People are drawn to those who are secure in themselves without being arrogant. Confidence shows through body language, tone of voice, and how someone carries themselves.
	2.	Active Listening: Truly paying attention when someone speaks, asking follow-up questions, and showing interest in others’ stories makes people feel valued and appreciated.
	3.	Empathy and Understanding: Being able to relate to others’ feelings and perspectives builds trust and deepens connections.
	4.	Positive Body Language: Open gestures, eye contact, and a warm smile can instantly make you more approachable and likable.
	5.	Authenticity: Being true to yourself instead of trying to fit into someone else’s expectations resonates with people. Authenticity often comes across as refreshing and trustworthy.
	6.	Humor and Playfulness: A good sense of humor and the ability to not take yourself too seriously makes interactions light-hearted and enjoyable.
	7.	Generosity of Spirit: Complimenting others genuinely, being kind without expecting something in return, and celebrating others’ successes foster goodwill.
	8.	Consistency and Reliability: Being dependable and keeping your word builds respect and trust over time.
	9.	Non-Judgmental Attitude: People feel safer and more comfortable around those who don’t pass judgment easily and create an accepting environment.
	10.	Passion and Enthusiasm: Expressing excitement and passion for your interests can be contagious, making people naturally gravitate towards you.

These traits help create positive, lasting impressions in both personal and professional interactions.",@zillaboop,UCBtF7U2GoYJMMikbRnIU7Kg,2547,2025-02-03T08:53:34Z,False,False,

I've felt invisible all my life and I do have alot going for me, not bad looking either but due to bad experiences I life I've found it hard to trust and connect with others. Bit of an introvert but charismatic in my own unique way, strong minded and driven, yet my confidence hasn't always been on point. I think sometimes it scares people and I like to help others find their potential or belief in themselves. With age I'm learning to care less about what people think. I see it as their loss but again I still find it hard to be accepted, I don't want to fit in, I just want to be understood. I care more about who I am and become rather than my popularity, I was a bullied kid who spent more time on my own than I care to admit. Your message was a great insight into this subject.

There's no inbetween, or doesn't seem to be an inbetween.. This gives so much insight in why I attract people in general. Natural charisma, but what if you don't know what it is that you do? The same traits that make people Love me and keeps them returning, are the same reasons I was targetted.. Thank you for listing this, it gives great information for introspection. Yes the interview is great, but seeing it written, makes it click. Now I know what to try to turn of if I am in the presense of someone I sense to be toxic.. 
Thank you!!

Because, dear people, a general warning; If you exhibit these traits naturally (and in that case you'll probably will already know this..) or apparently learn these via these types of platforms, toxic individuals *will be drawn to you* and hate you for who you are and try to destroy you!!",@Elketjeable,UCPGhAtRJIJQV_70dCabZV4w,6,2025-02-03T16:41:41Z,False,True,Ugz4EnsczTRsGmPmTut4AaABAg

People are not as welcoming of extroverts with confidence as they used to be, Gen Z consider Extroverts as too loud, crazy etc even when it is just normal level socialisation.

If you are in the right place at right time surrounded by the Right People only then cn you succeed regardless of introvert or exrovert personality and confidence level.

Perhaps he should be having more empathy for the way his actions were perceived by the vast majority of the planet who witnessed it, regardless of what he may or may not have intended. If it was truly unintentional, an empathetic response can be made, explaining why it was misinterpreted, and what the intent was. That wasn’t his repones and as much as I appreciate you believing in the character of this billionaire and trusting his integrity, it’s so hard to believe a man who possesses what some say is genius level intelligence, and has vocalized support for the alt right party in Germany, had absolutely no idea what he did. Best of luck to your and your channel. I sincerely hope my beliefs on musk and the team standing behind our president when he took office are wrong. But I won’t consume content by anyone who attempts to rationalize what’s going on, especially to the point of suggesting we should have some “empathy” on a situation as sensitive as nazi salutes being performed on stage at a presidential inauguration that commenced with racially profiling and terrorizing the Latino communities in our nation. ✌🏻❤️",@ashleysimon4009,UC0GfejgqOrg91KRS1sXnazw,14,2025-02-03T18:47:03Z,False,True,UgzB4pChA3k6JgXrhRd4AaABAg

Being honest, it is not easy to keep up with Elon as his views are changing frequently and he unfortunately becomes more extreme. Recently for example he got involved in European elections supporting the AfD party in Germany, where some of it's prominent members have engaged in Holocaust trivialization and are close to neo nazi circles. I believe Elon does similar things in Italy as well. I agree with Charlie that Elon should have clarified that he didn't mean it, but he did not clarify that, which could also mean that he actually wanted to please some groups. He did the salute twice and I am sorry to say that, but it looks exactly as it ""supposed"" to look. To understand Elon better, I highly recommend the biography by Walter Isaacson whom Steven has actually interviewed in regards to this book. As much as I admire Elon for his succeses with Tesla and SpaceX (but not for his management style), I think he is a dangerous person while getting involved in politics and social media with the power and money he has.",@user-dm4bp1xf4v,UCoWG3ccLoINXBIqK3iZ34Sg,1,2025-02-07T10:37:18Z,False,True,UgzB4pChA3k6JgXrhRd4AaABAg

U have to work on it urself amd not all manipulation is bad. Some ppl use it bad. That's not the same thing. If ur friend Is depressed and you do nothing to help them y are choosing to stay out of it and theyll possibly spiral n unalive themselves.  If u put urself out there and go try to cheer em up, engage in conversation, get them out of the house,  that's manipulating their situation. For the better. It's giving them an opportunity to connect to you. Sometimes that connection as the enttiirrrreee thing is about, makes a world of difference to someone. Us? Why are we here watching this? Something either happened in ur life like this guy and u woke up n realized you need to make a change n learn some skills to improve urself.  That's self improvement started by, urself and ur own drive. Or, someone reached out to you woke you up and gave you the confidence you needed to work on urself and come out of ur shell. Every. Single thing.  Is a type of manipulation. A parent redirecting their child's bad behavior into a positive behavior. Manipulation. Ur partner or a boss or a parent, making u feel like shit putting u down chipping at your worth.  Negative manipulation, a parent changing that what was done to them and making confident and conscious decisions on how to better Parent. Or how to learn to run a  business. Even learning a basic skill is still manipulation of the brain. Some  people struggle to learn and have to find ways to trick their own brain to learn better, just another form of manipulation. The news, usually Negative manipulation. The people we surround ourselves with manipulate our emotions and how we think regularly. So. Manipulation isn't mad. There something around you making u believe that it Is and to specifically not see aaaaaallllll the other things that are manipulating ur thoughts and feelings about it.

As a passionate artist who is socially awkward, I now understand how I come off as prey. I can't wait to try some of these tips out. I love this show, so thank you both.  But I gotta say, I was disappointed when things got political, and saw the obvious admiration you both have of Trump. He was rude in the debates, nasty, disgusting  and broke all the rules, and you admired this?!  Makes me pretty sad to hear that strong, intelligent compassionate,  men are so susceptible to the ""might is right"" theory. Trump is the worst thing that ever happened in the Country as far as spreading hate. ""Always attacking, interrupting, never admitting a mistake, and lying with bravado nearly everytime he opens his mouth are not good qualities.They don't make him appear strong to me. They make him appear petty, spoiled, nasty and out of control. Hitler was charismatic too. So was Manson. But to praise charisma alone, without more context is irresponsible, in my opinion.

And I don't agree that Democrats lose elections because they over react. The right over reacts in a much more obnoxious, lizard brained way, in my opinion. Trump just called the Muslim politian in New York a communist, for God's sake. So was Bernie Sanders according to Trump and Fox. And no one but Musk himself knows what his salute meant.
