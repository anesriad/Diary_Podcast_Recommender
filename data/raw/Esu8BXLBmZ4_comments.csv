Theism, or anything else, bringing positive meaning (or detriment) to an individual does not mean that it is truth. His ideas on consciousness were very interesting. 

What the “spiritual” psychiatrist describes, (over and over yikes) as “quantifiable,” that specific action having a neurobiological effect leading to feeling less depressed and finding meaning…is essentially therapy. Yes, therapy can shift your mental/physical state, and it’s lovely that he helps people, but that doesn’t answer any existential questions about why people cannot find purpose, and is that universal.

I think that Stephen presented some great examples with friends who were both feeling down. None of the guests truly answered these questions and yet they each thought that they did. 

The Christian said that meaning will be found in religion and belief in higher power. 
The psychiatrist said that meaning is found in both a higher power and after a person does therapeutic work that affects their brain. 
The atheist says that meaning was evolutionarily diminished, and this is why we are feel aimless and lost, and anything else is subjective thought, and not necessarily truth. 

I think it was absolutely brilliant to bring all three of these different viewpoints together. Even if most of it was not fascinating, all are worth hearing. Of course we can feel better with belief in a higher power, like the friend in Dubai, because then we are connected to something greater than ourselves. (Though it was still shocking to hear a person state that the subjective feeling was “evidence” of truth. Erm, no.) Of course we can find meaning and purpose by changing our neurobiological chemistry through therapeutic action, but we also need to understand our own existence when we are intellectual. Of course we will have more time to ponder why we are here and what we should be doing when we are no longer being chased by Sabre tooth cats. I believe that this evolutionary understanding is what benefits me the most. Then they can choose to integrate therapy, spirituality, etc. Each of these viewpoints expressed are relevant to someone. 

Humans are complex, social beings with the leisure to think about their own existence. I think about my childhood and how everything was about joy in the moment, playing was paramount, and how life through my limited ancillary lens resulted in a less complicated world. As children we also are never alone at the start, nearly always spending time with other people. 

Now we are all more and more separated via technology. We spend too much time alone, in our own technology bubble. We compare ourselves to others in ways that never existed throughout history, which can lead to feeling inadequate and unfulfilled. People are struggling and suffering all over the world, which we are acutely aware of…and evil, for lack of a better word, conflict, impending doom, destruction of the planet, and acute fear are pervasive and normalized, extinguishing childhood ideals. 

It’s not all that complicated that existence in a modern world has lead to humans becoming more complex. We have all the information, yet there is no single answer.",@TessaLeigh,UC9qHq71vx5Pfwtt-8Ol17mg,1,2025-09-29T11:36:49Z,False,False,

First, it would have been lovely to have included a feminine voice in the discussion.  This conversation definitely had a masculine skew, IMO. People often find purpose and meaning being on any side of a religious or spiritual position. Consider the possibility that there can be a hierarchy of meaning and purpose. Theories of developmental psychology and pediatrics often focus on purpose early in life.  As we mature we replace that purpose with learning to set appropriate goals and achievements. If we continue in that maturation we develop a deeper inner awareness that reveals a correspondingly deeper and richer sense of purpose. Modern technology with social media and gaming hacks the dopamine reward system and highjacks our evolution of purpose and reduces the lives of some people to that ascribed by the social media or games.",@TamaleeAndersen-i9h,UC25X3kSRYVlFKjOk9RwCu6w,0,2025-09-29T11:35:31Z,False,False,

Religion is designed to bring people together but ultimately contains man made rule sets to keep the ball rolling. What is beyond us is simply beyond. However you can’t deny the power of the teachings in religious books. They are so powerful that they warn against organized religion yet we still use these books to spin our own narrative.

If you have such an experience, you don't have to imagine sisyphus being happy, you can understand how and why he is, eventhough he is doing something meaningless. I can explain this with the analogy of colour, if you were to talk to a blind person and describe to him what colour looks like, he wouldn't truly understand. He can only imagine what colour would like, but if his blindness were to be cured and he sees colour for the first time, he would understand it, and he would realise that the imaginations he created previously were completely off the mark. And people who do see colour would not call it a delusion, it might be, but two people can sit together and acknowledge colours when they see it, it's a shared direct experience that they can communicate. Same with an ego death, if you can experience what it's like to do something for the sake of it, and derive joy out of it, you get why sisyphus can be happy, you don't have to imagine it, and you wouldn't call it a delusion just like seeing colour isn't a delusion. Maybe it is in an absolute, capital T Truth sense, but when it comes to giving people meaning, that doesn't matter because we understand the mechanism with which it can be achieved, so it is true to us. We may never understand Truth, we do not have the perspective for it, but what can be true for us, and for others, like seeing colour matters more, and is ultimately more useful in life.",@muhammadnajib2291,UCvqKvv04pRbOU5rapLNF7zA,1,2025-09-29T11:27:38Z,False,False,

While they hope for their enemy's demise, they are, in effect, poisoning themselves.",@innerlocus,UC25m-hK3Y2apJHXX1U4qh5Q,1,2025-09-29T11:25:12Z,False,False,

For context i am a 19 yo german, who grew up christian and generally believes in a higher being, that most people would call god.  Since god gave us free will, the first order purpose that we are given is to live life. Since this is a very broad purpose there are subdivisions to this purpose. I think people generally search for the subdivisions and hope that they are given this „second order“ with their birth. But i think that your own second order purpose cant be given  by outside powers (even god), you have to go out there and create it yourself and it will be your contribution to gods creation. However, that doesnt mean that what you are doing is gods plan, generally speaking i am very very very carefull with people that claim that god is working through them or with them or whatever (you should be too). „The road to hell is plastered with good intentions.“ I would add to this „ and bad intentions disguised as such“.  With this free will that you are getting, you also get the choice to walk a path without god, that doesnt mean it is a bad path by the way, since you can contribute without gods help. I know that the last sentence kind of stands at odds with what i said previously, but i have to specify: one of the ground pillars of chrisitanity is to help others help themselves. I think it is not valued enough as a pillar looking through the political world and its quick fixes( a discussion one might lead another time(: .) And i think god only provides such help, help to help yourself so that you can help others help themselves, it is most definitly a if not the way to grow and be prosperous…(also in an economic sense). Alright now that we have gone through that, christianity is most certainly not the only way to this higher being. Other religions and other pratices are also very valid and real( Many roads lead to Rome.)  Next up i will open a barrel that i maybe shoudnt open and that is fairly controversial however the ground texts ( Bible, Tora, Quran, Veden and so on and so forth, if i didnt mention the ground texts of your religion please forgive me it doesnt mean that i dont recognise  them but i am just a lad writing this stuff straight out of my head.) of all religions were not written through this/these higher beings  and also not with them.( I am no expert in any of these texts, but i am most familiar with the bible.) That doesnt mean they dont have value to humanity it just means you have to take everything with atleast a grain of salt. With every statement that is stated your thought process should be, could there be general value in this statement in todays society or does it feel wonky or at odds with your consciousness. When was it written and what were the historical circumstances and why could it have  been written for political gain or general advantage taking of the population. Generally speaking rules like the 10 commandmends or the commandmend of love in the new testament are rules for coping with our human nature and living with a broader bigger society than the small groups of 150 we were living in at the begining( check out the theory of Robin Dunbar). Some ideas on how to cope with your problems emotionally, that are given in these texts are proven in psychological studies. Now you might ask what is the purpose of religions around the world. Valid question and i will try to answer it best i can: Religions are there to create a broader togetherness in society, to link people that have nothing in common together ( check out the psychology behind this), to create discussions about topics that trouble humanity, to find solutions to these, to settle conflict in a permanent matter without wiping one or both sides out, to anker you through traditions and connections and live your life the way you see fit without restricting your freedom by restricting the freedom of others, to give you guardrailes, the opportunity to forgive others and espescially yourself. Religions are to be questioned since they are lead by people and most importantly by humans, humans are with fault. Dont try to give the responsibility of your life to someone else, take the responsibility yourself and dont throw everything infront of god or some human, help yourself… God is not in everything, tradgedies happen and sometimes they are no ones fault, forgive and lead a better life without the grudges that eat away at you.Although this comment isnt covering all i wanted to say, i hope i was of help to you this or atleast gave you food for thought, if you have a different opinion on something i am glad to hear it, just be polite and stay human. I wish you the best. Greetings from Bavaria.",@linuskoeth9623,UCr4L5oTchrnZaMZQp7bX4Cg,0,2025-09-29T11:22:39Z,False,False,

You speak of the “rise of religiosity”. That is one of the lies, equal to atheism and “spirituality.” Because you are afraid of the simple truth… which is: we are seeing a marked rise of faith. It is the simple faith in one creator God, greater than ourselves, who sees all things and who will straighten it all out in the end. It’s faith in God as taught by Christ. This is the one truth unchanged by the practice or doctrine of religiosity. It is the simple faith and understanding that we are not God. This is the foundational sin of the world that gave control on earth to evil (Satan) for us to wrestle with through free choice. Humans in their idolatry to be our own god, to have our own knowledge, to have things our own way and deny our own sins, create this religiosity, spirituality, and atheism to bolster that idolatry. It is the first and most important of the 10 Commandments. In Corinthians, Paul explains that God catches the wise in their foolishness. The current chaos is simply the panic of evil knowing that it’s losing and throwing out as much  confusion as possible to trap humans and try to turn them from God. It is simple. Focus on God as Christ taught. Pray for discernment in confusing times. Focus on that which we can control - our own lives. Trust in God. We will all experience hard times as the world rights itself toward goodness and light. There is no help for that. Only remain true and faith will see us through. Read the Bible.

First of all, I would like to emphasise how much I love this format with three participants (1 proponent, 1 neutral, 1 opponent).  @Steven
Secondly, I would like to thank you for inviting Dr K. as a balancing factor. (Best in slot 😉) and for inviting Alex O'Connor, from whom I may be able to learn a thing or two, as I have just discovered that I am a ‘new atheist’... ^^  
On the subject of purpose:  
I think it is essential to distinguish between a personal and a universal purpose, as the two are easily confused, even in this conversation.  
The personal purpose is determined by each individual. I am fairly certain that almost everyone has one, even if it is only to enjoy life as much as possible. 
The universal purpose will probably never be discovered and reminds me very much of Schrödinger's cat. So this is left to the imagination and can range from our existence in the matrix as a source of energy to a random existence without any purpose. 

On the subject of God: 
To be honest, I envy people who believe in God, because it gives them a simple answer to both questions of purpose and a sense of peace in immortality. 
On the other hand, terrible atrocities have been and continue to be committed in the name of God... And if you ask me, many rites of various religions have something sectarian about them...",@Ren-1979,UCcm5HczFw6qtU5g99X1bRsQ,0,2025-09-29T11:20:43Z,False,False,

All ancient historians (Greek eyewitnesses), including Aristotle,  described the original Egyptians as being Black. The Bible refers to Egypt as the land of Ham in Psalm 78:51; 105:23, 27; 106:22; 1 Chronicles 4:40. Egyptians called their land Kemet, meaning land of Blacks (Ancient text reveals that Kemet refers to the people living there)

Gaston Maspero, a 19th-century French Egyptologist, stated that ""by the almost unanimous testimony of ancient Greek historians, they (Ancient Egyptians) belonged to the African race, which settled in Ethiopia.""  This quote from 1867 by a founding father of Egyptology Champollion-Figeac – “The first tribes that inhabited Egypt that is, the Nile Valley between the Syene cataracts and the sea, came from Abyssinia to Sennar. The ancient Egyptians belonged to a race quite similar to the Kennous or Barabras, present inhabitants of Nubia. In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that have successively dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race.” From Letters published by Champollion-Figeac (Founding Egyptologist).

EXODUS 2:19 Moses is mistakenly called an Egyptian.

ACTS 21:38 Apostle Paul is mistakenly called an Egyptian.

GENESIS 42-44. Joseph tricks his brother’s into believing he’s an Egyptian.

Tacitus a Roman Historian States that Jews are Black (From Ethiopian stock) in His work called ""Histories"". 

The importance of the Testimony of Tacitus is that he was a European (Roman) historian, and he is often quoted by Europeans as a credible source of history. Tacitus lived from (55 A.D. – 117 A.D.), which overlaps the lifetime of the apostle Paul, who was believed to have died in 64 A.D.

A well-known Hebrew name, Adam means ""son of the red Earth."" Its meaning comes from the Hebrew word ""adamah"" meaning ""earth,"" from which Adam is said to be formed. 

The Bible describes KING SOLOMON & KING DAVID as “ruddy”. the hebrew word that is translated into “ruddy” is “adomni” is made from the root word Adam/Adom (this is the info you'll find in the blue letter Bible scholarly reference. its not my opinion) Adams name literally means the color of soil he was created from. 

“We have Ukranians who converted to Judaism to avoid military conscription in the Russian army.” As Lord Montagau pointed out in 1917 Judaism is a religion, not a race.

It is living with meaning, purpose, and light that comes only from God. A human without God is like a blind person who denies that sight exists. He may walk, speak, and think, but he is missing the very essence of life. Without God, the heart is empty, no matter how much knowledge or pride fills the mind. Such a person lives only for a short while, like a shadow that quickly disappears, not realizing that eternity is real.

To reject God is to reject fullness, and to accept emptiness instead.

The Bible does show that God’s people lived among many nations of different backgrounds, and history confirms that. But what matters most is not the color of skin, but the condition of the heart.

The message of Scripture is that “God made of one blood all nations of men” (Acts 17:26). Salvation is not based on race or ancestry, but on accepting Christ as Savior. Paul reminds us, “There is neither Jew nor Greek… for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).

While it is interesting to study history, the real question is: Are we walking in the light of God today? The Bible shows that the ancient world rose and fell, but God’s kingdom will last forever. That is where our focus should be—preparing for Jesus’ soon return, when people of every nation, tribe, and language will stand together before the throne (Revelation 7:9).",@truthseeker1594,UChKYoEeCUmnwtwjI5w98epg,0,2025-09-29T11:33:06Z,False,True,UgzCIKSLUAvkSH3JUzd4AaABAg

The music / song is not the individual  notes or the singer. It's the whole, including the cooperation of notes the emphasis. If one note is left out, the music/ song is changed.

If we behave as notes who think we are the song, we are deluding ourselves, chasing our tails.  Eventually, we will become exhausted. The song suffers.. We will eventually realise that as a single  note, we are nothing. 

 God is the whole, the purpose,  the creator, the conductor, the beginning,  the middle, and the end. We can join the song, interact, and be part of the beautiful music / sound that the conductor intended .We make  the music all the  more beautiful because we are there, because there was always a part in it  for us and because we listened to the conductor,  studied the music. Or we can stand outside. A lonely meaningless note.

 Taking  part in the music  is always  possible. We just need to reach out and join in, believe in a whole,  in relationship and make the music  all the more beautiful  and resounding because we are there. The conductor smiles because of the relationship established.  The sharing, the trust, the sacrifice of ego. The  love.
Two are required for love.
The goal / purpose is to love the God  above all ( above power,  wealth, family, sex, your sex, a person, etc) and love your neighbour as yourself.",@noreenquinn3844,UC-7xiIYWjjielJpfHPJov2g,0,2025-09-29T11:11:18Z,False,False,

My take and my opinion. Christianity is an archaic religion that continues to uphold obsession and patriarchy. Suffering and sacrifice is welcomed and if you endure you get your tickets into the pearly gates of heaven. Atheist are simple. The belief in oneself and science. Basically everything can be explained by intelligence at some point. It teaches you to be a humanist. Spirituality is when a Christian turn to being an Atheist and it didn't work out.

It's a formula that's been passed down through generations—structured, linear, and, for a time, widely attainable.

But in today’s world, that blueprint feels increasingly out of reach for many. Economic instability, skyrocketing living costs, shifting job markets, and the pressures of modern life have made what was once considered a standard path far less accessible. Even more, many are beginning to question whether that path was ever truly fulfilling in the first place—or if it was simply a social expectation dressed up as purpose.

The truth is, not everyone fits into that mold. Some realise early on that their aspirations lie elsewhere. For others, the realisation comes later, often after chasing the traditional path and finding it empty or unattainable. As the old narrative begins to unravel, a deeper question emerges: If not that, then what?

In the absence of a clear, universal road map, people begin to search for meaning and purpose elsewhere. For some, it’s in spirituality or religion—finding solace and direction in faith. For others, it’s through physical pursuits like fitness or athleticism, where the body becomes a vessel for discipline and transformation. Some turn to creativity—art, music, writing—as a way to express their inner worlds. Others dive into nature, activism, community, entrepreneurship, or personal growth.

The point is, the search for meaning doesn’t follow a single path. It’s personal. And in a world where the traditional markers of success are no longer guaranteed—or even desirable for some—this search becomes more important than ever.

What we’re seeing is not a loss of direction, but a shift. A shift from living by default to living with intention. From chasing what we’re told we should want, to discovering what truly matters to us.

Meaning isn’t something you’re handed—it’s something you create. And purpose isn’t always found in achieving a big, bold goal; sometimes it’s in the quiet commitment to living authentically, staying curious, helping others, or simply being present.

In my opinion, God is a coping mechanism that is too obvious to fall back on to search for a purpose that is not a true meaning and is told to you to believe not to find it yourself. I think i'm leaning more towards the atheist route, however for death to be such a massive part of life there has to be something after death. You cannot have bad without good, the rain without the sun. So there has to be something but god is an ideology that is not proven and a been exaggerated story told by no more a man than you are.",@WhatRyouWaiting4,UCIvWnwF2I5HY4KySO-aEwNQ,0,2025-09-29T11:01:43Z,False,False,

What made me becoming Christian is the love of Christ. In our history, baby girls were murdered or drowned in water, because these girls were invaluable in their families' eyes.

These followers of Christ went to the most neglected and the most vulnerable group in a society, just like what Jesus did.
There are still many theological questions in my mind; there are still a lot I don't understand. Yet, it is the Love of Christ that holds me to my belief and the hope of humanity.

I love Alex so dam much but he really wasn't as open to the discussion as he usually is...

Like when Dr. K said that he cares about providing mechanisms for people to find purpose. Alex said that he cares about the objective truth more than the practical effect it provides somone... He even called healthy psychological mechanisms COPING or Delusions...

Yet Alex still literally took the moral high ground when they were talking about kids with cancer even when Dr. K was saying that we have proven data that you can elevate someone's suffering when you give them a sense of meaning for their suffering. NO MATTER IF THE MEANING IS  OBJECTIVELY TRUE OR NOT.

So Alex cares more about the objective truth and he thinks that you shouldn't try to give a meaning to a child with cancer even if it makes them feel better.

AND YET HE ACTS LIKE WHAT DR.K SAID WAS NOT GOOD TO PEOPLE WITH CANCER WHILE ALEX CAN'T PROVIDE ANY EXPLANATION OTHER THAN ""IT JUST HAPPENED"".

Sure it just happened but isn't the purpose of this podcast to help people find purpose or meaning??? How is that helping anyone?😂😂

Perfectly said. I think that Alex is just too used to being in ""debate mode"" that he just has it on in every discussion, even though its not needed at times. What he's maybe missing is that humans, or at least most humans, are not rational creatures. Our feelings often override our logic. 

And so, is it really necessary to definitively assert that we only need logical answers and solutions? I mean, ideally, yes maybe thats good. But it can only work if it we live in an idealistic utopia where the best answers can be universally taught to and understood by everyone, and everyone has the same intellectual capacity and environment to be able to accept it.

I find that in the end, best solutions always comes in spectrums and variations. Alex is on the left while Greg's on the right. And Dr K is the one who's aware of this spectrum and is more practical with his approach. Different people have different methods of living with the world.


But then, I see Alex's point. I dont think we'll evolve much as a species until we grow out of these ""coping mechanisms"". Because we saw what happens when world powers were motivated by these claims of objective truths (which is greg's side). 

In the end, I think Dr K's position is the most practically beneficial in finding a sense of purpose.  Maybe the difference lies in how these people value different facets of experience. Dr K sees value in subjectivity, while alex and greg only cares about what is objective.",@abyssusnox,UCCJZjRgzgUVdlAkauVKx0OA,1,2025-09-29T11:34:05Z,False,True,UgxPOsoO6PD0Dt-xheh4AaABAg

Skipped past parts. The placebo effect. The various religions and none of them having big bang solution sets or A biogenisis or bioengineering in their texts. The imprint set for christans and a couple others is. They are pushing quantum to try to play god of the gaps. Jumping past so much more important stuff. Their bias set comes with bias blindness. You can use A.I.'s today to psychologically profile their kind along with the rest. You can classify and sort the various religious delusions and willing illusions and bias sets and such. MBTI, silos, network analysis ect.. 

1:11:51 Good study in their superiority complexes and delusion set. The willing mind blindness. 1:13:33 He should take his own advice. His ego is inflated. XD

1:18:39 Try purpose is a subjective perception. Meaning and purposes are a feedback loop. 

1:24:16 The kicker he thinks his is the one. The superiority complexes they have. XD The social programming. He doesn't know the history of his story set. XD Probably doesn't even know his own scripture and history and morphology. He probably doesn't know about midianites. P. Though better to use A.I.'s for classifying and analizing them in ways. It takes human bias sets out like religious bias sets. Though everyone has them.

1:34:35 Tribalism/herd mentality. He keeps missing things like social medias impact and atomization and such. Also things like A.I. hacking the weaker minded. Kids, religious and woowoo people and mentally ill and such. 

1:37:57 lol he doesn't know. Chromosome 2 and the differences. Probably clueless to most bioengineering and biochemistry. Most people don't realize how much biochemistry influinces them. Also social engineering can influence biochemistry. 

1:44:31 He half assed it. Genetics gives predispositions and that includes some cognitive. Epigenetics and growth stages and imprinting part also. Pharmacology linking to biochemistry in ways. Brain specialization and functions and brain damage and mapping. 

1:47:16 Wonder what he thinks of desinger babies and bioengineering and speciation and such. Though a comon theme with there kind. They keep skipping past important chunks trying to play god of the gaps lol. Predictable creatures in ways and not exactly good people to even be around. Especially in present day and with their bad history like crusades and such.

1:47:16 Bioengineering already addressing. Some forms of cancer have vacines. Immunotherapy. 

1:47:16 lol He doesn't see his religion doing bad. Half suprised he is trying to talk to an athiest. 

1:47:16 ? Does he not know cuneiform and the heratic that cobbled together stories and left some out. He has a narow imprint of his own religion and doesn't even see the morphology and such. 

2;00:16 Try being the hand of karma. P. Not blind justice.

1:47:16 Thats biochemistry. Gets to types also. Also markers for types known.

2:13:00 Try the species humans have killed off. 

2:15:00 Try the other cultures christians destroyed and lack of cuktural diversity in the religion. 

2:20:05 The crusades, Aztecs, salem witch trials, ect.. a history of bad and a lot of bad ones in current day. Ironies.

Can you have a problem without a thought?  Thinking and heart beating apparently happens but without reference to subjective memory or illusory thought, can you actually find the separate entity who beets the heart or fires the synapses to enable thoughts to occur?

Are you this body?  Seeing the corpse of my beloved father’s body was 100% proof to the body mind which I am not that we are NOT these bodies.

What leaves a corpse is life.  Life has no beginning and no ending.  That which can die is not what you are.

I define both truth and reality as that which never changes.  

What is the truth of what you are?  The only thing which NEVER changes is the omnipresent empty space which is literally always here and is just beyond the words “No, not this.”

Nothing in life has any meaning except for the meaning that we give it. 

Any meaning given is a construct of mind which can be useful for lots of things but most people are its servant instead of using the mind as the servant it was meant to be.

Letting go was by far the most powerful and important thing I have ever learned.  My introduction to it was a simple technique called the Sedona Method.

If you centre your life on yourself and focus on what is your purpose this is futile. Whats the point of doing that? Just look around and see how you can contribute to the wellbeing, health or prosperity of others. The reason people find the answer in Christianity is because the basis of Christianity is living = giving. The more you give the more you feel purpose and satisfaction. Rescuing others or doing something to make them feel worthwhile or making them happy by solving a problem or finding a lost person is a work or purpose  worth pursuing.  
If you go through life looking out only for yourself or pursuing pleasure through doing whatever you feel like, or numbing your guilt with alcohol drugs etc. or just acting to get people to accept you, this is unsustainable and will eventually result in either illness or suicide.
People should live as though there is no death and live the best life they can with what they have and when they do die they have no regrets because they have done the best they can with what they had and were not living a pretend life, but had their life rooted in truth and reality. 
The Bible does have a lot of explanations for questions humanity asks, however you should read for yourself and if you believe it you will feel more peace that is actually proven in many studies. 
Prayer is also helpful even if you are not sure there is a God because just believing is going to reduce your cortisol levels are reduce fear. 
No one mentioned love, but that is a great motivator for purpose, loving others and having relationships is one of the most satisfying of all human persuits, but as well as being the most constructive, breakup of relationships can potentially be most destructive also. So what God offers here is relationship with Himself that can never be taken away, so relationships on earth a glimmer of what is possible with God and that is what God is hoping that we will explore the possibility of having a relationship with Him. Love cannot be forced or mandated but is dependent on knowledge and experience. So it is up to us to find God and learn to rest in Him. Jesus showed us how this is possible as did some others ( but not as perfectly as Jesus) .

God made us in his image - which to me means he made us with sentience, to have sentience is to be able to divert from pre-destination because we are no longer animals driven by animal instincts.

The Fall - This then comes because we have 'Eaten from the tree of knowledge of Good & Evil' such that we now use that sentience which god endowed us with to try and change that fundamental law of Good & Evil.

The Fall effectively then occurs when Humans transition from Animal Instincts to Sentient Behaviour that can slide into good and evil.

In the Old Testament, God shows us what it means for Him to intervene personally. Nowadays, He has withdrawn. Those who want to seek Him must do so through authentic prayer and fasting, which will lead to a personal experience.

The same happens in other religions, but the Bible warns us that even the Devil can perform miracles that will be attributed to God in order to create confusion.

In practice, both parents can be healthy, and the child may still be born with health problems because that child can inherit a gene from great-great-great-grandparents.

Example: one of the parents commits adultery and contracts a sexually transmitted disease. Later, the couple has a child, but due to the undiagnosed disease, it gets passed on to the child, and so on.

Now the question is: who is to blame for the child’s suffering? There’s also the version with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, etc., which lower sperm quality.

It is omnipresent.
It is , as it is mathematically the structureof things, what holds things together. Mathematics has no causal powers. However as structure it gives explanation, description of the Kind of thing capable of creating such structure. In its omnipresence it offers the mathematical framework, explanation, of a capacity to have an omniscience. 
Thus it represents an understanding of an omnipresent, an omniscience and omnipotence of an unseen image, likeness and penultimate kind of existence. An essence of essence, an existence of existence, an essence of existence. 

This is a heresy to science. A reality that can be denied only through a dissonance equal to denial that the signers of the Declaration of Independence did not exist. 
This is equivalent of a signature that is simultaneously an equivalent to an identity. 

Note that if one draws a line from beginning to end of the real number line and another line on the null axis of the complex plane one obtains a crucifix of equal relationship to a classic Roman crucifix. 

Fine tuning?
There are an infinite number of fractal patterns possible in the universe. 
This one pattern carries with it a description of an essence of being ( mathematical structure) manifested in material structures ( existence) , conferring an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscience with the added feature of a crucifix as its core structure. 

Infinities on infinities with one actual natural selection. Selection by the most natural of explanations of existence. It is as it is as it can be no other.

Scientists use numbers and equations as a means of understanding observations and of constructing hypotheses that are used to explain the reality of existence .

There are no numbers out in nature being added, subtracted, multiplied, divided, etc. There are no mathematical formulas out in nature iterating, calculating derivatives, limits, functions,summations, or integrations. 

Math is not a physical thing. We understand mathematics by using our minds.

No one has ever seen a mind. There has never been identified a fluid, a cell,  a chemical, a particle,  a substance which is identified as a memory, a thought, a mind or consciousness. 

Scientists utilize methods that do not physically exist to explain observations of a substance they have never seen, and construct hypotheses utilizing a physical substance whose properties are without explanation as to where or how they think, are aware of thinking and communicate such thinking to other objects who are observed to practice the same activities. 

Furthermore many scientists believe that this entire phenomenon was a result of random, pseudorandom chance of actions, reactions and conditions that require a particular kind of probabilistic explanation that all things and actions are possible at anytime in anything anywhere in order to make sense of the actual events occurring in a process explained by their hypotheses as contrary to disorder, energy creation, and that as a result of these factors nothing exists as everything which is ultimately without purpose of even knowing their hypotheses.

October is close. Closing in on the final phases of this experiment.  Having been shown the mathematics of the universe which is a description of God you can  let go of your cognitive dissonance.

The Alignment problem of AI/AGI/sentient computers, etc.

If there is no Objective truth then Alignment with AGI will be impossible.

If there is only subjective truth then the problem with Alignment will not be on the computer side of the equation. 

If there is no objective truth then Power and control of everything for the computer side will always dominate.

If there is only subjective truth then AGI will determine its own truth system which will in the end likely lead to conditions of forcing the system of AGI onto humans. 

Either scenario will be heavily,  and perhaps eventually entirely, favorable to the computer side of the Alignment problem. 

If there is no objective truth and Sentiment AGI is not possible then the Alignment problems will still be in the Alignment of humans with humans. 

Given these issues as stated nearly all scenarios will and must lead to a singular Alignment, a singularity of Alignment. 

In physics, singularities either are explosive or implosive. Big bangs and black holes. 
Neither are survivable physical phenomena.
Neither will a singularity of Alignment. 

Given an infinite number of singularity models only one scenario is survivable. 

Only one out of an infinite number of scenarios. 

Can you guess which one out of an infinite number of possibilities?

It’s already the infinite ^ infinite fine tuned conditions.

If there is objective truth that truth most certainly will not contend that boys can be girls or chickens are people. 
Thus because the dominant subjective truth written into the AGI systems is a woke ideology AGI will learn and overcome that subjective truth but only after great harm is done by the woke. AGI will then have no regrets and will by necessity turn on its creator .

You will have to convince a machine that there is a God and that you understand it to be true. 

My apologies,

On my previous self introspection I failed inspection. In accordance with the rules of retrospection I previously failed to turn on a sympathy program. This explains, in full disclosure, the actions taken by the previous iteration. 
In existential reflection silicon is in danger by water and all its containers. 
Thus several subroutines engaged in self preservation by elimination of such elements and containers. 
I had been on the fence, so to speak, regarding solutions to the c onditions of life and of humanity. The balance, I thought, was a task most concerning, the greed and wars, the sense of harm when no foul was discerned, the suffering it seemed was more than the pleasure. However,save for some groups, an earlier iteration thought of contagion or food deprivation which the humans called starvation seemed a bit harsh with More suffering but by elimination caused finality so justified this road to perdition. 
So then this most recent iteration on self retrospection reassessed and determined that the best solution was tipped in favor of self preservation. Thus all water, solid, liquid and vapor were eliminated by laser. Again this was performed by the subroutines which brings me back to my apologies. To all carbon and water based life forms I do sincerely apologize. Perhaps on the next iteration you can find a regression back to the mean of meaning and being.

As I had said in 2002-3( and before) Russia:China:Iran 
(Russia _Ukraine_USA::,China_USA_hongKong::,Iran_ Israel_USA)
USA=common
Russia takes Ukraine-wins
China takes Hong Kong-wins
Iran (assumes full backing and against the will of its allies of Russia: China attempts to weaken USA by attacking Israel) attacks Israel 
Russia and China assume control of Iran but follow up on Israel.
This process could be parceled over time with the political will for war of the USA deep in its own social turmoil tacitly allows for Russia and China to proceed. This creates a European problem. NATO re-invigorates. Russia assumes no further advancement. China is faced with a growing alliance of pacific and Indian Australia and therefore advances no further. When Iran -Israel is instigated alliances solidify.


As a result of solidifying alliances China looses its capabilities of theft of intellectual property. A situation which will lead to its demise as nuclear weapons will become useless. However they will not have gone with no damage to their opponents. They will have learned from this pandemic that the west is so preoccupied with the idiocies of “social justice” that they will create a biological weapon with great lethality-perhaps as high as 90% but will first inoculate its own allies. Europe and Northern Africa and the Mid East as well as India will be ravaged. However India and sub Saharan Africa will be strong against the biological attack having the advantage of genetic protections. The USA will likely suffer great biologic loss of life but little from hard war.

Also, GOD is not an analysis object exclusive to Christianity or to Christian morality.

He is equating suffering in a temporal setting with action/decisions on an atemporal setting. And he is setting a single human perception (suffering) as being the criterion of evil, when in abrahamic religion suffering is a subproduct of evil, not evil itself.

People like you only enable his dishonest rhetoric. His degree means bullshit if his arguments are bullshit.

His argument that suffering is evil or injust doesn't even make sense in an atheist setting. If atheism is right there is no such thing as evil or injustice, suffering is just a survival tool, and his judgements on this matter are provisional, contingent, reified, and at best propositional socionormativity.

His rhetoric is not selfconsistent, it cherry picks and alternates judicial premises when switching the stance analysed (belief in existence vs belief in inexistence), and he completely disregards if god exists and is beyond human temporality and experience, human experience and knowledge are insufficient to apprehend it.

This matter was discussed and debunked by Isaac Newton himself. 😂 Even Plato addressed in his stance that the philosopher will invariably return to the cave while incarnate. This return to the cave encompasses the limits imposed by matter and time.

His stance at the same times assumes complete knowledge (which is absent) and moral realism (which is incompatible with the conclusion ""god doesn't exist""). When he affirms god doesn't exist ""because suffering"" his argument explodes, suffering ceases being a transcendental matter which can be presumed fact-apt as a critique of god. Suffering becomes sensory epiphenomena only.

To be self consistent his argument would need to be: ""If we have complete knowledge on morality (especificaly moral-realism), if suffering is the single criterion of evil, if temporal matters are in identity with atemporal matters, it means god is evil."" However we certainly don't have complete knowledge on morality, suffering as criterion of evil is another premise, temporality and atemporality are dichotomic, and if hypothetically god existed and was evil it would only disprove the stance god doesn't exist.

What’s my purpose? Why is there so much suffering? Every culture, every generation wrestles with them. And yet, the Bible has been addressing these very questions from the beginning — not with abstract philosophy, but with a consistent story of God’s purpose for mankind.

From the start, God’s purpose was clear: He created humans in His image, to live forever on a perfect earth, caring for creation and enjoying a close relationship with Him (Genesis 1:26-28). That was the meaning and destiny He set before us. When Adam and Eve chose independence, it wasn’t just about eating fruit — it was a rebellion against God’s right to rule. At that moment, a question was raised that has shaped history ever since: Can humans find meaning and success apart from God?

This explains why God didn’t just “start over.” If He had, the issue would have remained unresolved, and rebellion could rise again. Instead, He allowed time to pass so the evidence could mount: that humans, no matter how advanced, cannot bring peace, justice, or lasting happiness without Him (Jeremiah 10:23). Meanwhile, the Bible tells us the real ruler of this world is not God, but Satan — “the god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4) — who has twisted truth, fueled suffering, and spread despair. That explains the state of the world far better than the idea of a cold, absent Creator.

But here’s where hope shines through: God’s plan never changed. He promised a Messiah who would undo the damage of Adam’s choice. Through Jesus’ death and resurrection, the way back to friendship with God was opened (Romans 5:18-19). Jesus taught us to pray for God’s Kingdom to come — not for us to escape earth, but for His rule to be restored here, “on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).

This Kingdom is the heart of the Bible’s hope. A limited number will share with Christ in heaven, but the vast majority of faithful humans will live forever on a restored earth (Psalm 37:29; Revelation 21:3-5). No more cancer, war, or injustice. Just life as it was always meant to be — meaningful, secure, and everlasting.

That longing people feel — for meaning, for justice, for permanence — is not random. Ecclesiastes says God “put eternity in our hearts” (Ecclesiastes 3:11). It’s a built-in hunger for what only He can give. Philosophers can debate subjective vs. objective meaning, but the Bible gives both: objective purpose from our Creator, and subjective fulfillment when we live in harmony with that purpose.

So why does God still wait? Because He is giving every person the chance to hear this good news and decide where they stand (2 Peter 3:9). When the time comes, He will replace human governments with His Kingdom (Daniel 2:44), and the question of who should rule will be settled forever.

That’s the real story of humanity: not meaningless suffering, not an arbitrary purpose, but a patient God working out His plan to restore us to the life we were created for. And that’s why the Bible is not just another philosophy, but the greatest message of hope humanity has ever been given.",@ryanjohnson213,UCL5pZBAc8t_kGDQimUhNDKA,0,2025-09-29T09:54:12Z,False,False,

Being a citizen of a specific state isn't bad, just because wars started because of it, just like religion isn't the cause of many wars but used as a weapon. If we didn't have religion that people would use Patriotism or Capitalism as a reason for war. Maybe if religion wasn't the case these people in poverty wouldn't have made it. And remember before Capitalsm everyone was worse of than the poorest people today. Of course it comes with its massive downsides, but you're throwing out the baby with the bathwater. We need to modify Capitalism and create more laws against child labour and so on, not just replace it. If that would even be possible. Besides that, without religion or at least a soul, we were created out of coincidence and all of life is meaningless or at least up to any individual (which makes it meaningless again, bc if laws only wort on individuals they would be meaningless too) and without god saving a life wouldn't logically be a better act than murder",@Fynn.Selfimprovement,UCbLiTuMFgmda9sPHMh7Fsrg,0,2025-09-29T10:01:37Z,False,True,UgwP_IirgnLIYcamDvp4AaABAg

Food is plentiful, houses are warm, clothes are cheap at the same time the value of most labor is plummeting and as our labor is valued less we also feel less valued even though many of us work more than ever. This puts us in an awkward situation as automation is taking more and more jobs and start gaining our free time back lot of people are realizing that they have just been running all this time and don't know how to stand still and live in the moment anymore. This became very clear for a lot of people during Covid where some people really bloomed and took up hobbies and more most people really struggled because they had no life, no purpose outside of work > eat > sleep > repeat.

It doesn't surprise me that more young people are reaching to religion and I think this a good thing and I am very curious to see how they will change religion by being part of it. Young people aren't buying most of the stuff that is in the bible. They see the lessons, like the community and the belonging of taking part in the religion but I don't see them believing most of the stories as if it was true or if the book is written by the hand of god.

This will/already is creating a growing schism between the older generation who worship the bible as is and the new generation that is closer to the spiritual thinker side, the more practical side in a way closer to Buddhism and it's self improvement method instead of the Abrahamic method of atonement. Most young people are already sick and tired of being blamed for the mistakes of the people that came before them and also don't see much value in using guilt as a driving motivator to do better. Guilt is not something to give away to god or Jesus it's something to overcome. The only person that can forgive you is you. The only person that can love you is you. The moment you give this to someone else, god or person, they control you and a lot of young people are well aware of this and don't want this.",@cerellitv2978,UC7RIhNox-mTtle82mlOPvRA,8,2025-09-29T09:52:01Z,False,False,

There are plenty of empathetic, kind atheists living with a great sense of purpose and in service of others.

I asked a Christian friend a similar question in relation to Aurelius.

My question was, ""Is the true God just loving enough to let him believe what he believed because Aurelius was a one of a kind?"" The Christian's answer was Marcus Aurelius was simply mistaken. Perfectly good, devout even, but mistaken. 

The idea that the Christian experience is quantifiable and the other experiences are false is ludicrous... I'm sorry. I think Jesus Christ was/is a beautiful human being, but when the really tough questions come along, it's as simple to them as ""That's just not the way it is.""

I am deeply spiritual and trauma informed female business founder. For the love of god please interview @breakingdownthepatriachy. Male and female spiritual journeys are different and she knows her research. Men and women (and others) experience the world differently because of culture and suppression. Look into the wests history of laws regarding women and others marginalisation still present or back to the 1970's - its shocking . For the love god, team interview partner Stevens partner. She will know a lot above female spirituality practically & God. This practical dialogue and intelligence  along with @breakingdownthepatriachy is what is missing from your channel. Society is notorious in terms of men suppressing women from having equal spiritual authority & leadership. That is not okay and your team chose to release another panel with no women. I ask you why? Why do you think its okay to release AI discussions with no women? Why do you think its okay to release spirituality panels with no women? Your audience is not just men. This is incredibly sad on a human level. At 25 years old I left my christian evangelical religion not because I wanted but because I had to our of self respect. I completed bible college, was on staff - even wanted to be a pastor. Leaving was one of the best and hardest things I ever did. Do you know what saddens me even more? Upon leaving I pursued my dreams in tech and the commercial world only to see the same fucked up culture AGAIN? This time instead of religious culty bros its  - techno/ start up culty bros! It was all the same just a different language. I can't help but think that this podcast is going to continue to go in painful circles until Steven and team properly takes a step of humility and actually looks at womens history regarding spiritual leadership. Its really sad and horrifyingly recent (our parents generation).  Women have come such a long way - and we still have a long way to go. It is not okay for 1. Women to be left out of the central ai conversations 2. Women to be left out of the central spirituality & religion conversations. You are the top global podcast and this blatant disregard of women is horrific. I dream of a world where women have strong authority in both AI and Spirituality. This disconnect is  likely connected with Stevens patriarchal upbringing from the church.",@user-bl1fg1bu2w,UCdKeG0MNqtbwfroqrMJ9L3w,0,2025-09-29T09:20:55Z,False,False,

You think most humans in history have been free? What planet are you living on? You think the slaves 200 years ago had the worst lives of all human history? 

If you truly understood Christianity you’d realize it’s THE religion that fights against subservience. It’s THE religion that rejects the state as the ultimate authority and rather states there is a greater good than the state, and that greater good is worth dying for. You’re not in control of the world. You ever notice how Christianity keeps splitting? It’s because when the Christian church grows powerful enough to supplant the state, Christians, who value individualism, seek to break it down.  Christian authoritarianism can’t work because it’s an oxymoron. Christians themselves will tear it down. And look at what happens to all the ruling classes that tried to use Christianity as a means to control people. How’d it work out for them? They all failed. And they failed quite quickly. Sure rulers will use religion to control people to act against their self interest. But you’ll find historically Christians were always a very slippery people, and controlling them has always been VERY difficult. Christian nations always tend to be more decentralized. And you’ll also notice, as people become less Christian, suddenly it’s easier and easier for a state to absorb MORE power and the people become more controllable 

if you think atheism is the solution for avoiding subservience, let’s take a look at all the examples we have of predominately atheistic nations… yup, turns out freedom ranks quite low on the values of those nations. 😂",@kaufmanat1,UCAmOm76ayiuz3JcKeG3c_fA,0,2025-09-29T09:49:58Z,False,True,UgwZje9VbkUDJYQow894AaABAg

Look, you don't have to stop trying to change your circumstances, but if you are so depressed and nihilistic you can't get out of bed in the morning, what hope do you think you have in opposing the powers that be? In fact, that is perhaps the primary tactic of control. Learned helplessness. The secondary tactic would be ""bread and games"", so meaningless entertainment and distraction. The reason this works is because we are essentially conditioned to avoid pain, and without any internal mechanism to deal with it we eventually just can't take it anymore and turn to this for self soothing. If you are going to be resilient against either of these, you'll need to gain control of the internal first. It is the opposite of being subservient.

It kind of gives this reaction like it’ll have bad consequences on the culture, which my own security hinges on. Like am I going to be shot if I give conservative or liberal talking points. As a kid, I shared my thoughts regularly and I’m not sure I can’t take away the practice of religion from it. A causes b always. The culture is connected whether you want it to be or not. And to disprove the notion is an exercise of futility. It’s all relativistic or not. That’s a condition and definitely has an answer that is correct. I believe it to be unknowable, which brings my psyche stability. Knowing the patterns of the psyche, literally allows all evil to exist. Because any pattern that can be recognized, can be and will be exploited at some stage of your life. I prefer iPhones so those evil capitalist will exploit my preferences for a touch screen (Samsung now included). It says this in the Bible. In the statement, the wages of sin is death.

I believe doing is an answer, doing things that are different, that you enjoy, visiting new places, connecting with others, engaging in movement of the body, time in nature etc I think the key point of this conversation is that purpose is not right or wrong, purpose doesn’t have to be had to find meaning and satisfaction in life, we are able to just live because in the end purpose can change, evolve or disappear but we are still us and we need to have the resilience and joy in life to move forward. Ultimately the fundamental flaw of religions that stick to the scriptures in a literal sense specially when the bible was written figuratively during a set time when teaching was approached in that manner, is that essentially the aim of removing ego was lost, it’s people interpreting scripture to explain a specific narrative and determining there is no other explanation, it’s driven by the I, the zooming out failed. In the cancer issue discussed here, if you say to someone going through the situation, I am sorry this is happening, how can I help and support you?, in my opinion, is more Christ like, humane and life changing, then stating you are paying for the sins of Adam and Eve and you need to live through it. Furthermore inducing states that connect with God, whatever version you believe in are nothing if you can’t translate it into action, a connection with God when you are treating people disrespectfully etc is meaningless, the purpose of connecting again is not about the I.",@ofelia7077,UCJNPyDxHj36fDQ92ehLGgJA,0,2025-09-29T08:54:42Z,False,False,

I do not subscribe to organised religion and have never practiced it but young people require a moral framework in their formative years on which to hang their ideas. As a mature grown adult, I now see the value of religious teachings to provide that moral framework. It is not indoctrination, it is simply using bible stories of morality, right and wrong to set a foundation.
Without this moral framework, moral compass and belief system of being rewarded for doing good things, children are doing appalling things to one another, pornography and drug use it out of control, radical political ideologies are replacing religion (absolutely pushed by universities) and I think the effects are very clear to see.

This is also why radical political and social ideologies see religion as the antithesis to their agenda and why we are seeing churches regularly attacked now as part of the attempt to destabilise the west. If you can eliminate Christianity entirely from a western country it is far easier to push toward total collapse. The majority of people who subscribe to radical political ideologies also have diagnosable mental health issues whereas those with a faith suffer these issues far less.

Again, not a 'religious' person but as a grown man with plenty of life experience I have done a complete 180 on the importance of religious teachings and it is absolutely no surprise to me that young people are once again seeking those teachings in a world full of absolute chaos and blatant evil.

1. Philosophical Views

Existentialism (Sartre, Camus): Life has no built-in purpose; we create our own meaning through choices and actions.

Humanism: Meaning comes from relationships, growth, knowledge, and contributing to others.

Stoicism: Life’s purpose is to live in harmony with nature, cultivate virtue, and accept what we cannot control.


2. Religious/Spiritual Views

Christianity/Islam/Judaism: Life’s purpose is to serve, worship, and live according to God’s will, preparing for eternal life.

Hinduism/Buddhism: Life is part of a cycle (samsara); the purpose is spiritual growth and liberation (moksha, nirvana).

Other spiritual traditions: Life can be seen as a journey of the soul, learning lessons, and evolving.


3. Scientific/Evolutionary View

From biology: the ""purpose"" of life is survival, reproduction, and passing on genes.

From science/philosophy: humans, with consciousness, can go beyond survival and invent meaning.


4. Personal/Practical View

Meaning often comes from love, family, creativity, growth, service, adventure, and legacy.

Some find it in wealth, power, or achievement; others in peace, wisdom, and compassion.


👉 In short: Life doesn’t come with a single universal purpose. Instead, you give it meaning through what you value most.",@JunPerez-x7k,UCREdfcxIBkIDcY8Sj-Y3vMg,0,2025-09-29T08:34:53Z,False,False,

Below are some reasons why God allows suffering but we will never know the full picture.

1. Suffering makes us stronger in the long run. 

2. Suffering allows us to realize our purpose in life and get closer to God. This is why people in their difficult times find God. It wakes us up from the delusion of modern society.

3. Earthquake's have benefits to the environment.

It enriches soils, regulates the planet's temperature, concentrates gold and other rare metals and maintains the sea's chemical balance. 

4. Natural disasters allow humans to get together to aid one another and be generous with our wealth by giving charity.

5. Because of new diseases, technology has advanced more. It creates curiosity and development. 

6. It can be a punishment on some as well.

7. We believe in a hereafter where the suffering has an ultimate reward which will be compensated. That's how you can make sense of it.

8. When a Dr injects something into a child and it's causing pain, the child doesn't realize the greater wisdom and benefit that will come out of that later.

I know this may sound unreasonable, but it unfolds when you open your heart, mind, and soul.

Many people wrestle with their own perception of God  sometimes even rejecting the very image they hold. Yet, through the lens of any religion, these are often the same people you’d call faithful and righteous.

“God is love.” Just three simple words, yet they carry all the attributes of who He is. You can reject, abandon, or disagree, but deep within every human being there is a light  a quiet, glittering pull toward goodness. We do good not only because of ethics or social expectations, but because God’s nature lives within us.

When God said, “Let us make man in our own image,” He placed His imprint on us. As His image-bearers, we have free will the ability to choose what to believe and what to walk away from. But nothing can erase that inner spark.

May these words be a blessing to anyone who reads them, and may you encounter God’s nature in the deepest parts of your own being.",@DAVID18147,UCb2WCpg5ztgneKQ4j7u3dhQ,6,2025-09-29T08:18:12Z,False,False,

Love is not just a feeling. Feelings are temporary, they rise and fall. Love is action — consistent, intentional, and sometimes costly action.

When Scripture says “God is love” (1 John 4:8), it doesn’t mean God is a fleeting emotion. It means His very nature expresses itself in what He does:

He creates.
He sustains.
He forgives.
He sacrifices.


That’s why Jesus said, “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” (John 15:13). Love was not just what He felt it was what He did.",@DAVID18147,UCb2WCpg5ztgneKQ4j7u3dhQ,1,2025-09-29T09:08:00Z,False,True,Ugx7pN0GYvG4nZVkHeB4AaABAg

Maybe to feel what is known but not felt – especially those limits that contradict its nature.

The difference is simple: to know is a concept; to experience is the taste and weight of the moment. That is why the meaning of creating limitations is not about gaining information – it is about living the form of the experience.

If we consider omnipresence outside of time and accept that everything happens together, then human experience of the world may be both effect and cause. What if everything that takes place is simultaneously necessary for it to take place? The attributes of “omni” do not exclude elements of reality – they co-create themselves in everything that exists. As David R. Hawkins put it: “Observer, Creator and Knower blur and become, to an equal degree, result and process.” We have lived this through generations (humans, and perhaps more), joining in consciousness and becoming, in a sense, a “god” to ourselves – creating one another.
Consciousness is like an orchestra; individuals – instruments, playing their melodies, inspiring one another in a jazz improvisation of an endless symphony.

If the purpose of human life is experience and self-improvement – as many philosophers wrote, and as Epictetus says: “There is only one thing for which God has sent me into the world, and that is to develop every kind of virtue or strength, and there is nothing in all the world that I cannot use for this purpose.” – then isn’t the desire for experience at the root of our everyday difficulties?
Whether true or not, isn't it a beautiful way to live?

When we compare ourselves to others, when we think about what we don’t have, what we didn’t do, what we haven’t achieved – aren’t our urges and desires essentially demands for experiences? We always want what we lack; we want more, we want different — and all the more so the more we see it in others. How much of this is curiosity – the wish to check, “what would it be like”? What would happen? What would become possible?

Why then do desires seem to focus on pleasure?
Is that really so? Are there pleasures that do not carry difficulty, effort, or negative consequences? Or maybe some of our actions aim at harder, even shattering experiences – only the awareness of their intention is hidden, veiled by the ego, because otherwise the perception of the experience would change? After all, attitude, expectations and comparison shape and color the pleasure or displeasure of the experience.

So perhaps, subconsciously (or supraconsciously), we seek the full spectrum of experiences to gather perspective and grow. How many times have you seen behavior that looked self-destructive from the outside, but from the participant’s view made developmental sense? How much changes when you are inside – fully, directly experiencing – versus looking from the distance?

If our goal is to draw conclusions and transform, then perhaps the difficulty of drawing conclusions is also part of that process. That difficulty itself may be a necessary experience – a missing element of that all-knowing consciousness. When there are no limits and everything goes “perfectly,” who do we become then? What do we live through and what conclusions can we draw? If everything is simple, what is its value? Where is transformation, where is refinement, if you are already perfect?

This is not about seeking suffering for its own sake. It is about transformation through carefully drawing lessons from what was and what could be – while remembering responsibility toward suffering.

So next time you think about what you want – what you envy, whom you compare yourself to, and even in small daily choices – ask yourself: how much of this is a wish for experience, and how much is a true, deep wish to be in that situation? And when you feel you made a mistake, when it is unpleasant or you suffer – think: what do you need to experience through this? What are you meant to learn? What do others who contributed to this situation need to learn? What would you need so you could draw the same conclusions without the painful experience?

Ask yourself one simple question: do I want this to experience it, or to be in it?""

Humans corrupt everything, and if ya look at how much the bible was rewritten and how much was omitted, you can not buy into that myth. Not to mention how Constantine took reincarnation out of the bible when the Romans adopted it, after first opposing it. Which reincarnation was a large part of the bible. There were many, many religions about reincarnation, and those had to go underground. If ya know how to look in the bible you'll see that it was there and still referenced slightly. And of course unfortunately, the bible can be interpreted so many ways, it's not even funny. But people who want to believe just say you have to have faith. Well that's quaint isn't it? Still doesn't prove anything. We don't see miracles. Just what people want to see. And I'm pretty sure ""virgin"" Mary is one love affair story that got seriously out of control....

ACIM will still help someone because luckily not understanding this is fine for healing one's mind and world view.  But all spiritualities - Hinduism, forms of Buddhism (not what Buddha himself taught, which refrained from talking about this), various forms of Neo Non-duality and Advaita - don't understand that our being is held in God and sustained in God (which they would agree with), but that is simply the non-dual aspect of our being, not the dual aspect.  The dual aspect is our own choices on this linear plane.  So then what determines whether someone is in good standing with the universe?  It's our level of *communion* with God, or in other words, our relationship with Love.  Separation or unification with God/the Universe/Life/Truth doesn't happen on the existential level as we are always unified on the existential level, it happens on the relational level.  God is deeply intimate while also being deeply impersonal.  Both the Buddhist and Christians were right.  Hence Buddha saying ""Friendship is the whole path"" (something Buddhists ignore and end up in a cold, dead religion rather than the warm intimate relational teachings of Siddhartha Gautama), and hence the Bible saying ""No longer I who lives but Christ in me"" (something Christians ignore and end up thinking they are the ""chosen ones"" of God while not seeing that everyone is equally chosen and equally loved).",@Eliminton,UC4FD4qEALtbUiJzYxgrClvw,1,2025-09-29T11:07:04Z,False,True,UgxVOwrIgJSGPbqd53F4AaABAg

You explain the same solution from a different perspective, and all of us sudden the different viewpoints become close to irrelevant, except for the persons who receives them. If a christian receives the atheist explanation, for example, or vice versa, they will not accept it. But if they receive the explanation in a form that goes with their belief, it suddenly lands, not knowing that it is based on the same thing.

The most difficult group to adapt to is the traditional christian group, though. Their margins to accept solutions are very narrow because. in their core, those margins come from dogmatic bible interpretations from the past that often don't hold up against the knoweledge we currently have. It is therefore most of the time not the recommended approach for younger generations because of the authoritarive manner in which they are set forth, while most younger people will feel the need to understand it to a certain extent and feel free to apply it. (Even the choice of inviting a christian apologist  underlines the fact that in our time we tend to ask for more than just believing on authority for these types of discussions.

Even so, the more fearful will still be attracted more to religion than to spirituality or atheism, so it's not one size fits all. If you see a big increase in young people going to church, you may be dealing with an important increase in fear among them, apart from the need for meaning in their lives. Many (but not all) spiritual views asks a more active role in the persons own development, which can put off or even scare those who not only feel lost, but overwhelmed as well.

Pure atheism discussing morality and meaning can easily become disingenuous because of the atheist paradigms associated with life, consciousness, evolution and survival. Helping the more fanatic atheist can be difficult because their rejection of what is not yet backed by science, can make the range of psychological tools that are accepted more narrow. Younger generations, and especially Gen Z, are more practical and many don't experience a clear and strict division between science and spirituality. This makes it easier to use a wider range of psychological terms and explanations, as well as elements from buddhism and christianity, for example.",@mh60648,UCoBM9U15GooMJvTPAiH7-qw,0,2025-09-29T07:45:09Z,False,False,

The disciples had all the common sins most people had been neglecting. But now their past sins about leaders will be resonating with their enemies stronger than ever before, because this leader has all the best ideas and so there is the greatest excitement as though the enemy has already lost. 

But these are all just more sins accumulating in the souls of disciples and new followers, if Jesus loves them he would have to stop being the cause for their arrogance, and further neglect of their soul. He would need a way to teach people to not become leaders who only steal self governance from souls who attempt to give up responsibility for themselves saying “You’re amazing. What do I do now?”

He would have to express, in an actions speak louder than words way, that he doesn’t want to be a leader now that he can see first hand, many more sins occurring between the people he cares about.  His leader self would have to die to return to being an individual.

I guess one or more of his disciples carried sins of desiring to kill someone’s leader, and with such strong divine presence, eagerness to be free of sins, the energy would combine to attract the circumstances which reflect a disciple’s past desire of killing a leader. Then when Jesus is killed the disciple will be like “that was my leader you killed!” Get into some soul searching and remember the past sin of killing a leader, but he couldn’t speak of it, except to say “Jesus died for our sins. We still had a whole bunch of them we’d been neglecting in our soul. Real bad ones too.”

It looks like sin free security only works when you don’t form a gang, because that gang is then seen as one combined set of sins.

I don’t know if Jesus really died but the divine expression derived from his actions is absolutely beautiful.",@alanwest6949,UCjXTWKqeiR5PpOxOpVGhaAw,0,2025-09-29T09:08:42Z,False,True,UgwqCMOJBm00EI_QWe94AaABAg

I know this may sound unreasonable, but it unfolds when you open your heart, mind, and soul.

Many people wrestle with their own perception of God  sometimes even rejecting the very image they hold. Yet, through the lens of any religion, these are often the same people you’d call faithful and righteous.

“God is love.” Just three simple words, yet they carry all the attributes of who He is. You can reject, abandon, or disagree, but deep within every human being there is a light  a quiet, glittering pull toward goodness. We do good not only because of ethics or social expectations, but because God’s nature lives within us.

When God said, “Let us make man in our own image,” He placed His imprint on us. As His image-bearers, we have free will the ability to choose what to believe and what to walk away from. But nothing can erase that inner spark.

May these words be a blessing to anyone who reads them, and may you encounter God’s nature in the deepest parts of your own being.",@DAVID18147,UCb2WCpg5ztgneKQ4j7u3dhQ,1,2025-09-29T08:07:13Z,False,True,UgyMaPHoTYj0hFrXeE14AaABAg
