Short answer: keto is not a cure-all for mental illness, and there’s no credible evidence it “cures 43%.”
But it’s a legitimate area of research—with early, promising (still small) studies—especially as an adjunct to standard care.

What we actually know

Strong, established use: epilepsy (especially drug-resistant, often in children). Multiple reviews show meaningful seizure reduction; this is where keto has the most medical backing. 


Serious mental illness (emerging data): small pilots suggest ketogenic diets may improve symptoms and metabolic health in people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia when added to usual treatment—but these are feasibility or open-label studies (no or limited controls), not large RCTs. Results = “improvement,” not cure. 


Depression/anxiety: early case reports and planned RCTs exist; evidence is preliminary. 


Why might keto help (the hypotheses)

Ketosis can shift brain fuel use (ketones), affect neurotransmitters (GABA/glutamate), reduce neuroinflammation, and improve insulin resistance—mechanisms relevant to some psychiatric disorders. Evidence here is mechanistic and early-stage. 
PMC

Safety & who should be cautious

Keto can be safe for many with proper supervision, but it’s not benign:

Kidney stones: pooled incidence ≈ 5.9% on keto, much higher than background. 


Lipids & CKD: LDL-C/ApoB can rise; CKD patients are higher risk (acidosis, stones). 
Oxford Academic

Other issues: constipation, micronutrient gaps, “keto flu,” and rare euglycemic ketoacidosis (esp. with SGLT2 inhibitors). 
Frontiers

Bottom line

Keto is evidence-based for epilepsy.

For mental health, it’s experimental but promising as an adjunct, not a replacement for meds/therapy. The “43% cure” claim isn’t supported by current science. Large, well-controlled trials are still needed. 

If you’re considering trying it (with your clinician)

Treat it like a medical trial: continue your psychiatric care; add keto as adjunct.

Prefer a whole-food, unsaturated-fat–leaning ketogenic pattern (non-starchy veggies, olive oil, fish, nuts; limit ultra-processed meats).

Baseline & follow-up labs: lipids, kidney function, electrolytes; discuss meds (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, lithium, antipsychotics). 
Oxford Academic

Track outcomes weekly (mood scales, sleep, energy, weight, side effects).

If risks are a concern, consider lower-carb / low-glycemic approaches that have some seizure and metabolic data and are often easier to sustain.",@moshehpr1,UC3XecJZ9MHOq8bAL1tDJxcg,0,2025-09-30T12:47:36Z,False,False,

I started to feel worse and worse, very tense (after initially feeling soooo much better) and also developed a dairy intolerance as I just couldn't stomach much meat (even fatty meat) and loved cheese and cream, which allowed me to stick to it.  I soldiered on wihtout dairy using a lot of coconut fat and olive oil, but I never really felt better on it after that and found it really hard to stick to without dairy.  It did work to reverse my insulin resistance but for me it wasn't sustainable in the long term.  I didn't eat processed anything apart from salami - so no low-carb products and generally stuck to less than 50g carb a day from vegetables dairy and nuts,  some days much lower.  Afterwards I added back a little fruit and felt much better, but sadly didn't stick to this and gradually added more and more carbs (whole food) and although initially I could tolerate these and did much better mood-wise, gradually i became insulin resistant again and at this point I am in pretty bad health and seem unable to tolerate any restrictive eating at all...I just eat non-processed but it's not working .....:(",@Lopsa192,UC_mTYNH1CKtTfdKy2SeseGg,0,2025-09-30T12:25:25Z,False,False,

Depressed as I was I comforted myself with a lot of cookies and it got my attention that it made everything worse within 20 minutes after eating the whole box.

I have seen the following changes in my health/wellbeing since commencing the Keto diet two weeks ago. 

My skin cleared up within 3-4 days. No pimples, pock marks or spots were observed. My sleeping became more restful as a result of less tossing and turning. My RLS (restless leg syndrome) has disappeared completely. 😳🙏I also had a had a much calmer demeanour throughout the day.  

The biggest and most important change however was associated with a physician diagnosis of ‘pseudo gout/arrhritis)’ that I was suffering from in the top middle of my right foot. It was so bad after going for walks (b/w 5-15ks) that the next day I would be hobbling around and the next night’s sleep was almost impossible as there was no comfortable position that I could place my foot in, that would allow me to sleep. The pain was constantly annoying. (BTW, it wasn’t alcohol-related because I barely drink. 

Amazingly, after only 2 weeks on the keto diet, I can now walk anywhere up to 15ks without ANY pain or inflammation in the foot. I simply couldn’t believe it! 

I’m now continuing on my keto journey for a few months to see what else I can get out of it. I really can’t see myself returning to eat carbohydrates any time in the future because the diet just seems to get me. I’m now down 6kg two weeks after starting the diet. 

Thanks again for posting the interview. I 15:50 hope my story is able to assist others with similar issues. Best regards 🙏",@davidsylvester5321,UCT91OOyHcGL5VN5-PeB2vow,0,2025-09-20T07:23:39Z,False,False,

I have in many occasions been very depressed and that has always coincided with the feeling of ""going crazy"". Incredibly vivid dreams, out of body experiences and a weird feeling of being ""watched"" all the time. Luckily I have always recovered and today (in my 40's) I have a stable life and business with my life partner. I tried the ketogenic diet for the first time when I was about 30 yoa. It was biblical! All physical issues went away, aking knees, back problems, joint problems and of course, my head became like a well oiled machine. It was like stepping out of the fog. Suddenly I could concentrate like I always felt ""everybody else"" could concentrate. No more ""dips"" where I almost fell asleep at work - I now feel wide awake the whole work day and evening, until i just get tired aprox at bedtime, like a clock and I wake up feeling refreshed. I sleep like a king on the ketogenic diet. Teeth - it feels like your teeth is always just brushed, my swollen, red and inflamed gums became flat, bright pink and now look healthy like in a toothpaste commercial. My stomach, WOW.. - it just stopped existing. I forget that I have a stomach - on the ketogenic diet its never swollen, never akes, never talks, no nothing, it just works and does what is supposed to do. Yes of course, it is hard totally switch to the ketogenic diet and quit with all those refined carbs and sugars - you have been an addict since you quit breast feeding, and if you only got the poison of ""formula"" u are definitely an addict since birth. But I recommend doing the hard why, just quit and change to the ketogenic diet immediatly. Your body will thank you, and if you are over 40 yoa in matter of days your body will feel 20 years younger. If you are a ""healthy person"", you know the ones ""who can eat anything"" and still be skinny and have perfect skin, the ones who naturally takes two or three tablespoons out of the ice cream bucket and ""feel full"" or just stops without thinking about it - these people where made for the high carb diet - and we are different - we where made for the ketogenic diet. Its just as simple as that.
Of course there can be issues in the beginning, like ""brain-fog"" for a week, feeling heavy and fatigued during workout, and bad breath, but that will goaway, and it is well worth the wait.
Another benefit that people like me - gaining weight incredibly easy and a true sugar addict and ALWAYS hungry or having craves is that I can go for a whole day without eating, YES IT IS TRUE! I still cannot believe it myself. I naturally after about 6 months fell into a routine of eating once a day, at around 4-5pm when I came home from work in the afternoon. Of course, weight quickly became a none issue. I became as skinny as I was when I was 17. But please do not think that the ketogenic diet cures sugar addiction, it does not, it just is an enormous help when you feel the great difference in your body and mind without the blood sugar rollercoaster - it helps ALOT to know that you can feel like a healthy strong human being. You are what you eat. And of course, when I speak of the ketogenic diet, it means ALOT of fat - I had to totally let go of the ""fat-scare"". I started eating butter, focused on the fat pieces on the meat, several eggs per day - and my body and mind thanked me for it almost immediatly. I remember the third day, I ate breakfast, eggs, bacon, and 17% fat russian yoghurt and my stomach was totally quiet, not a whisper. I felt such calm.. And even though I became very full, I did not feel ""bloated"" at all - I have now realised that the bloated feeling is 100% connected to grains, sugars, and carbohydrates.",@HogbergPhotography,UCTScKEF_b_ddBXLx2u9jX6Q,0,2025-09-03T04:24:54Z,False,False,

It's not about eating meat it's about eating high protein combined with healthy fat or oils. Please look into that and do an interview about that as getting everyone eating meat isn't the answer.

I see this having eaten keto from 2017-2023. Strict for a few years. For example, she pulls the evolutionary biology card about our ancestors not eating six times per day. Ignoring the fact that they would eat every single bite of carbohydrates (ie) whenever it became available. Another: carnivore and keto are largely elimination diets. A lot of the benefit comes from removing junk/additives. Not necessarily from depriving the brain and body of glucose (which is so important that it has an emergency generation process AKA gluconeogenesis). People also remove foods they are intolerant too. When you complete a metabolic ward study or supervise patient nutrition in person, of course they will get healthier on any reasonable diet. What she didn’t say: yes, strict ketosis can indeed reduce blood sugar in the short term. Over the long-term, fasting blood sugar often rises (as it did for me) due to chronic elevations of stress hormones like glucagon and even cortisol. Very common. Anyone that wears a CGM will still see a roller coaster of spikes and troughs during long-term keto. You simply force your body to waste energy elevating stress hormones and breaking down either dietary protein or even lean tissue to generate glucose. Leptin resistance on keto is also a thing. Fiber, a form of carb, is widely considered the most satiating macro. There’s also a misconception that your body needs high insulin levels to store fat as body fat. Actually, the easiest macro to store as fat is… as the name implies, dietary fat.

Although I don’t advocate it by any means, you can look at the popular  “sugar diet” and see countless stories of people losing significant weight eating higher carbohydrates. The insulin model is incomplete at best.

However, I learned about nutrition and recipes which I still use today to manage carbs and.my macros. I had done Carnivore and within two months I ran into Kidney issues so I reversed course. My diet has been optimized and it is better than when I was doing strictly Keto. I feel even better. What I do today is eat in a 500 calories deficit and avoid carbs as much as possible. However, an occasional cheat meal doesn't back fire because my body is fat adapted. The most important part of my new diet is progressive weight lifting, and increased protein. These two points are the game changer no one is talking about in this thread. The increased protein helps to keep and grow my muscles. Also at age 53, I noticed I am so much stronger and lifting things and my balance is so much better with my core and leg muscles. This will help as I age more. Game changer.

The concept is for the body to use foods as  fuel, not as filler. Think of the variety of peoples over the world, depending on geography. 
People also have different blood types and dna.
Im drawn to fruit,  fresh vegetables, not usually cooked. Whole grains, mostly oats, little meats, fish, poultry, legumes, some dairy. That diet is the best for me, and most of my family.
The additives, pesticides, gmo produced foods, are a big part of the issue. Processed goods, a big part too. 
Shoving pills for everything is the biggest issue.
Alcohol, drugs as recreational imbibing also a problem.
Add to that digital technology, the crap being fed to our brains from news, all social media also contribute.
The last that has collided all this into a melting pot is mass migration over the world ,to Western countries. 
Government loves that we are now all sheeple and be controlled due to the chaos. Immunizations are out of CONTROL. 
NO BABY, needs bombardment with foreign crap before they are 6months to a year .
The labels of  autism, adhd, formed primarily since the mass immunizations have been in play for 3 decades. Funny how all hell broke loose with mental illness since then.

There are a FAIR amount of people that have NO idea how to eat how she is talking about and do it PROPERLY.

1 of the things that I absolutely HATE about the wellness category of medical professionals is exactly THAT...they're more worried about their viability in the industry and longevity than they are about TRULY saving lives...no MATTER WHAT.

I can't afford 100 books on psychology, psychiatry, proper human diet (which is essentially MEAT, eggs, etc). And...I've got a job. People who are chronically ILL, DYING, etc and have NO idea that the SADiet is 187ing them?

HOW and WHEN do you think they're going to stumble upon this person, have the MONEY that isn't going to medical bills, medications, rent/mortgage, gas, etc to FIX THIS part?

They're not.

There comes a time when we in the medical field HAVE TO sacrifice quite a bit if we expect the needle to MOVE in a real way.

The fact that NO one makes their books $1 tells me a LOT about their real goals and worries in life and it is NOT people's health. It's THEIR bottom line. They're going to make you PAY to access LIFE saving information.

I really enjoyed seeing you here and hearing you speak.  Your arguments and explanations are clear and concise and eventually unfold over the entire podcast (fellow listeners, please listen all the way through).  In addition to your obvious expertise and knowledge, you seem extremely thoughtful and deeply caring about people who struggle. And how SEEN I feel by hearing you describe the intense suffering that can result from ADHD, along with your facial and vocal expressions, all of which which directly communicate the profound nature of the disorder as well as your empathic nature.  It is not something that can be printed in a book.  It was also so reassuring to hear acknowledgement of the unique skills honed by the necessary adaptations made in order to feel safe in the world, e.g., hyper-vigilance, that can become one’s sensing superpower, and the lack of a linear life. Very perceptive. I would love to stop my meds, and while I’ve adjusted to eating whole foods and cutting out processed foods, vegetable oils, etc, I have not broken the sugar and refined carb habits.  Now, I’m beginning to embark on a more keto way of life & figuring out what this looks like while not including red meat (for personal reasons), and exploring sweeteners that do not spike glucose. I’ve seen what’s ahead for me through my parents’ final years. I feel their urging me to do it differently.

Can It Cure 43% Of Mental Illness?》 的中文核心觀念整理：

🧠核心觀念（中文整理）：
✅ 生酮飲食不只是減重工具，而是「大腦代謝療法」
生酮飲食可使大腦燃料從葡萄糖轉為酮體，這種切換有助於穩定腦神經元能量供應。

對於情緒障礙、焦慮、躁鬱症等精神疾病，有實證顯示生酮飲食可改善症狀，甚至使患者停止使用藥物。

✅ 43% 的精神疾病可能與「腦代謝障礙」有關
傳統精神科以神經傳導物質為核心，如血清素、多巴胺，但這只是結果，不是根源。

許多患者的大腦實際是「能量代謝異常」，如神經元胰島素阻抗，導致功能低落。

✅ 生酮飲食可改善：
~~大腦胰島素阻抗~~

腦部發炎

神經能量不足

增加粒線體功能，有助於提升腦部的代謝效率。

✅ 改變飲食 ≠ 不尊重藥物治療
~~精神科醫師（Dr. Chris Palmer）強調：飲食是額外工具，非替代藥物，但有潛力讓部分患者逐步減藥甚至停藥，前提是需醫師監督。~~

~~✅ 類似帕金森症、癲癇、阿茲海默症，也都與大腦代謝異常有關
生酮飲食對這些神經退化疾病也展現療效潛力。~~

對腦部疾病的重新理解：「這不只是化學失衡，而是代謝疾病。",@葉瓊鞠,UCfVFSW1h99_hv2uoLV3jtSA,0,2025-06-25T21:52:25Z,False,False,

Your enormous and good-looking fruit has no flavour at all, and carrots have a taste here, and they are quite sweet. Meat with eggs, cooked in dripping are a terrific meal, and until recently Australia cooked its fish and chips in dripping or animal fats. Now they have moved to some foolish seed oil, and they taste terrible in comparison.

Taking a vitamin after touching a doorknob?  Glutened!  The less I have (none is best) the more optimistic and calm I remain.  My hubby with adhd is a big hugger, and would lie about recent exposure to not slow down hug opportunities.  He even tested me, by experimenting and lying, and discovered my body and brain do not pretend to have this.  It’s the food!  Easy to dislike such a situation.  People near me are usually kind enough to stick to certified gluten free foods or not eat contaminated food around me.  As a result, I get to live a sane life.

Dietary fiber is ""essential"" and ""improves disgestive issues"" WHEN the diet is a standard, food-pyramid-type diet, which is NOT the discussion here. The ""community note"" FAILS to take into consideration the keto diet's much higher fat content. Higher fat content replaces the digestive assistance that fibre provides in other contexts, and a high-fat diet also is a much slower and steadier digestive process than a high carb food-pyramid diet.

This is a perfect example of people being unable to shed ideas that they have been taught for decades without a solid foundation of understanding about which they have been taught. Dr. Ede was completely correct in her statement and the ""community notes"" demonstrated yet another complete understanding of the topic AND the point she was making.

However, its health benefits are well-established in the scientific literature, and it plays a crucial role in:

1. Digestive Health

Promotes regular bowel movements and prevents constipation.

Feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support colon health and may reduce inflammation.

2. Metabolic Health

Helps regulate blood sugar levels by slowing glucose absorption.

Aids in lowering cholesterol by binding bile acids in the gut.

3. Weight Regulation

Increases satiety (feeling of fullness), helping with appetite control and weight loss.

4. Chronic Disease Prevention

Associated with a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, and even all-cause mortality in many large-scale studies.

5. Detoxification

Binds to certain toxins and excess hormones (like estrogen) to help excrete them through the stool.

Scientific Consensus

Numerous health organizations — including the World Health Organization, Harvard School of Public Health, and National Institutes of Health — recommend 25–38 grams of fiber daily for adults, depending on age and gender.

If you're wondering whether humans can survive without fiber: yes, technically — but the risk of chronic diseases, poor gut function, and systemic inflammation increases significantly. So while not ""essential"" by strict biochemical definition, fiber is functionally indispensable for optimal long-term health.",@michalleshar879,UChehhlTI_H1EapZ26METlTg,1,2025-05-27T12:47:56Z,False,False,

The phrase everything in moderation must be one of the most unhelpful pieces of advice ever produced unless you are the shareholder or chief executive of  a highly processed  food company. The keto diet was the first to try  and quantify carb level …some sites offer visual aids of what 50 grams of carbs look like in real terms. It is not vested interest of doctors, dietary bodies, and food companies to be clear.. vagueness allows for everything to be incorporated within the diet “in moderation” thus allowing the shift of the blame from producer to the consumer for not adhering to moderation. .

The keto diet may work for some special people, but you dont always have to drastically alter your diet if you are already eating healthily.

People should start by cutting out all processed food, eat a varied organic diet and get a full blood work done to see if vit D and other levels are at recommended levels.

Ketosis is an emergency function we've evolved to survive the absence of the bodies favoured energy source: carbohydrates. It's not a magical life hack. There's so many videos about keto and carnivore etc. And so few that just give the sound basic advice of avoiding the crap that is passed as food today.

It also helps control blood sugar levels, particularly for individuals consuming carbohydrates. The idea that fibre is unnecessary or harmful contradicts extensive research showing its numerous health benefits.

as Dr Alan Desmond says: 
In this interview, Georgia Ede dismisses fibre’s role in gut health and motility - an assertion so wildly off the mark that it barely warrants a response. 

The overwhelming body of scientific evidence contradicts her claim: fibre plays a crucial role in maintaining gut function, promoting bowel regularity, and reducing the risk of conditions like diverticular disease and colorectal cancer.""

As Dr Gemma Newman says ""Fiber isn't just about regularity - it's the preferred fuel for our gut microbiome, which influences everything from immune function to mental health. To dismiss fiber is to ignore decades of research showing its role in reducing chronic disease risk and supporting overall vitality.""

Let’s not forget fungus feeds off sugar and the gut microbiome is messed up from so many people due to dozens of rounds of antibiotics over the their life. Candida actually causes leaky gut/leaky brain like she was talking about.
I have a strong suspicion that this plays a role in people’s transformation too because fungal overgrowth byproducts are toxic and literally make you feel poisoned causing all the same symptoms as the conditions she speaks of.

I’ve spent many years studying nutrition and the connection between food and disease, and I’ve come to a strong conclusion: real health comes from eating organic, whole foods. That’s where you’ll find the real nutritional value. Food supplements of serious companies do help, but it's mainly whole organic food that keeps people healthy.

Exercise is another key part of staying healthy—just 30 minutes a day is more than enough. And for those living in large cities, my honest advice is: get out as soon as you can. The stress and pollution in urban environments can seriously disrupt your insulin and metabolism, which even the best eating habits can't fully protect against.

I really admire Dr. Georgia Ede, the guest I was listening to. She began to question her own lifestyle and eating habits when her work as a psychiatrist didn’t produce the results she expected. She found herself feeling drained by 5 p.m. every day, even though she was only 40 at the time. In contrast, I remember being 40 and staying up for 48 hours straight and still feeling energized—though I know now that kind of habit isn’t healthy either.

My wife, who’s a pharmacist with experience in the pharmaceutical industry, is still shocked at how little most doctors know about nutrition—even at age 62. They’re trained to treat symptoms, not root causes. But it’s not really their fault. Medical schools often don’t include proper nutrition education because the system is geared toward selling medications, supported by funding from big pharmaceutical companies.",@brunodiscover1814,UCnvyZn3QhISF5FoGjIM4f-w,1,2025-04-22T23:34:49Z,False,False,

I had to rewind parts of the interview several times to get it all as one can get caught up in the calm, soft delivery and becoming too relaxed to focus.  I already did a carnivore diet 1.5 years ago and lost 50lbs.  It also reversed many personal health issues.  Holidays and retirement caused me to drop my focus and I started consuming sugar, pasta, bread, etc.  I felt like garbage again physically and mentally.  This time I am dedicated to a ketogenic lifestyle for the ease/variety and I already feel great again just a week in.  The feeling is so familiar from the last time around and obvious.  What was interesting is after those mere 5 months of normal unhealthy American diet, I went back through a keto flu (same with carnivore the first time) for 2 days as my gut microbiom was rebalancing.

P.S. - I have also paid real close attention lately to the mouth microbiom as Dr. Mark Burhenne, DDS explains in many interviews.  I think one change needs the other and am so happy I came across that interview.

Everyone knows how altering a diet and limiting good protein, practically cutting out all cholesterol is not healthy. (Except for this bizarre lady it seems !). If you find what she’s saying to be big news and informative then good for you. For a lot though, this is very basic common sense stuff. Your brain needs many vitamins (especially B vitamins) to function well and the best source of these are from animal products. NOT a plant based diet.

When people are desperate for a breakthrough—and saturated in transformation testimonials and podcast hype—their nervous system is primed for change. They’re not just starting a new diet; they’re enrolling in a belief system. And belief can be powerful—sometimes even more powerful than the actual biochemistry.

To be fair, keto does have solid science behind it for certain conditions like epilepsy and insulin resistance. But the leap to “keto cures depression, anxiety, and ADHD” is often overhyped—especially when it’s served up with cinematic music and the reverence of a TED Talk meets salvation message. Even intelligent people can get swept into that placebo-powered current.

And here’s the kicker: most people trying keto also overhaul their lifestyle. They sleep more. Cut sugar. Quit alcohol. Go for walks. Track their meals. So if they feel better—was it really the ketones? Or was it the frappuccino detox and basic self-care?

Bottom line: feeling better doesn’t always mean you’ve nailed the cause. When wellness trends become quasi-religious movements (looking at you, biohackers), it’s easy to mistake emotional enthusiasm for clinical evidence.

I was on keto for over a year and it was not a great diet for me. I know it works well for some, but keto was the closest I ever came to having an eating disorder.  It’s way too strict. Add in the intermittent fasting that is often presented as part of keto, and it really screwed up my body and my relationship with food. Also, the lack of carbs resulted in less success in running/strength training (for me). My body was too stressed. I also didn’t lose that much weight. I found later on that a more balanced lower carb,l diet, with around 100g of carbs a day works best for me. All of my meals have a little carbs, fat, and protein. And I never skip a meal. That’s what works for me and I’ve lost most of my fat taking this approach. 

I will say that I have many friends that have found success with keto! But staying on it 100% of the time seems to be incredibly hard and limiting socially, so not sure how sustainable it is. If they veer away from keto they bloat like crazy. I know I bloat much less now eating carbs with most meals than I did when I was on keto, not 100% sure why. 🤷‍♀️ just my experience in case there are others who have not had success on keto. It’s not for everyone.

True, fiber does what Dr. Ede says, and it also is indigestible - *by us. But* it is not indigestible by the microbes in the microbiome of the gut. And that is the key thing fiber is for. That biome is made up of many varieties of microbes, all with DNA that has no particular relation to us. We have some trillions of cells in our body that have our DNA, but there are just as many of these microbes operating symbiotically in us. They perform different functions, usually enabling our own cells to perform chemical transfers between cells, or healing and cell-building functions. In the gut, one of their key activities is to protect and nurture the membrane that separates the bowel from the rest of the body, maintaining the protective barrier that permits only helpful chemicals and microbes to pass through. In this way, it is the first stop for repelling hazardous or poisonous materials from passing into the body as a whole. With fiber, we feed the biome, not ourselves, and like all living things, they also need to eat to stay healthy. This is the principal reason why I will never move to a carnivore diet, but will remain on ketogenic with intermittent fasting. One meal a day seems to work fine for me, giving my body ample room for keto healing during the day. But I am a type-II diabetic and am still working on reversing my insulin resistance. Perhaps one day, I will recover some of my lost flexibility, but for now, I can live with any way of eating that does not return me to that unlivable state of being I once lived.

Oh, one more thing. Forget about losing weight. That's not the point at all. And if you eat properly, your extra will just drop off naturally over time (and not that much time). It's not necessary to beat any speed records with that anyway. It is necessary to regain your health as directly as possible.",@farmergiles1065,UCUh98P-MMu7cRYb1hab568w,1,2025-04-04T02:47:04Z,False,False,

Okay cool, so while breastfeeding, that's great. I'm 35 weeks in and also want to breastfeed if everything turns out ok.

No question the Keto diet can help people in many ways. BUT, there are zero longterm studies that show it's healthy. What we do know is a huge body of rigorous studies that show eating meat (all cooked meat) is not only unhealthy, it is the leading cause of the number one killer in the US--heart attacks. If that's not enough, high-heat cooking of meat  (grilling, frying, broiling) produces HCAs, PAHs, and AGEs—compounds linked to cancer, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Meat can also contain dioxins, toxic pollutants in animal fat that disrupt hormones and raise cancer risk.

Food for thought.

So while keto can help, it also can cause diseases if a person is on it long-term. Almost any diet can help a person lose weight, but the goal is not to fit into a skinnier casket. The goal ought to be losing weight it in a healthy way. We're all on a journey, and I sincerely hope the very best for everyone.",@steven.peters,UCCK1IITtJvth7odZSBlf2CQ,3,2025-03-28T19:34:20Z,False,False,

Just reading through the comments….a couple things caught my eye. Someone asked about people in other countries not eating keto and not having health issues. First, there are people there who have issues….. it is a lot less and different kinds! Just like the China study book, previous generations made it easier to conclude some case studies because the food of their culture was more consistent and people didn’t move away as much. Second, I heard someone speak of a study that showed that metabolic damage is passed down from mother to child and through generations you could wind up with whole people groups who can tolerate different foods better than other people groups. Also, I’ve Guinea pigged myself for years trying to get healthier because of gout. Well, in 2007 I practiced what’s called the Daniel fast for 3 months with some friends. I couldn’t believe how it affected me! I lost 52 pounds in 3 months, gout symptoms disappeared, slept better and brain fog went away! After 3 months of it I started feeling a bit sluggish so, emotionally I slipped back into eating the standard American diet. Over the years I would resort to that style of eating and it would help a lot in the beginning (3-4) weeks and then I would get some weird stuff going on with me I didn’t understand. Over time, that weird feeling got worse and worse. A while back I learned I had diabetes and knew automatically that my diet was needing some tweaking! I was already eating clean and decided to go ketogenic. I’ve maintained good blood pressure and my blood sugar levels got much better! After connecting some dots I learned that my gout and blood pressure problems weren’t the result of eating meat but rather mixing the fatty foods and sugary foods together! I’m finally feeling level all day long, not just my energy but also my mind and the way I feel emotionally! I don’t have the explosive energy I used to have but I’ll trade that any day for the well being that I feel now!

Could it be its not the lack of Carbs but the lack of carbs in lower quality foods which is the key factor in remission.  I don't think anyone in the med is on a keto diet but they also don't eat the amount of processed food we have for example in the uk.  Carbs exists in fruit and veg and so on... we need these foods. The fact is we don't need keto. This isn't a process our body needs to hit in order to be healthy. Whole foods.

Just curious Steven, If a Keto diet makes you feel so good and I have heard you say it in several interviews, why only do it part of the year? I have been on a Keto/carnivore diet for two years. Started at 232, got down to 173 in 9 months but the two holiday seasons derailed me as my krypto addiction is chocolate. I gained 15 pounds and it has taken vigilance and determination to get back to 180. Yes, I fail or fall of the wagon as they say - but start again - not is all lost - so I gained a few pounds and the A1C spike up. Sure then I get a head ache or feel crappy sometimes but I just take a OTC pain killer and am good to go. I was on a blood pressure med - off now, I was borderline diabetic for years hovering just under 7 -now in the mid 4’s most of the time. Had neuropathy in feet and legs - that is a greatly reduced and nerve damage takes a long time to heal so hoping this year it disappears totally.

There are so many things I could bring up to argue my case. 

First of all, our physiology is not ideally adapted to consume, nor digest the flesh of cows, pigs etc. Biological beings adapted to eating flesh have short intestines. They consume flesh in its pure state (raw - bl00d  and all) , the same state in which herbivores are ideally adapted to consume food from the plant kingdom. The tooth structure of carnivores is also very different from that of herbivores, including humans. 

I do, however, think that there have been adaptations over time for SOME humans due to living in much colder regions where there was little to no vegetation. 

I think for those of us who  originate from tropical climates though, our bodies are best adapted to eating a plant-based diet -  ideally  raw.  I have been on many different diets over the years and made different lifestyle changes. The ONE diet that my body absolutely thrived on most was a raw, plant-based diet. While I was on it, I was doing 80% - 90% raw, plant based. Everything. .  .and I do mean EVERYTHING in my body became balanced and optimized. I stopped getting menstrual cramps, I stopped getting breakouts and my skin was like glass for the first time in my life since I was about 5. I even started to get muscle definition in my arms without doing any strength training, which I had never in my life had before.  I felt light and vibrant and beautiful.   My depressive episodes only lasted a few days at best before my mood would lift again. Anyone who knows me, knows that I  could sometimes be in the throes of depression for months and months at a time. Unfortunately, I went completely off course with this dietary change when my life got uprooted  and I had to move back to the USA.

When I was on the keto diet, however, I didn't feel good at all, even though the excess  weight came off. My skin was a mess! It was oily, yet dry at the same time and my pores became more enlarged.  My skin didn't look plumped up, youthful and firm like when I was on the raw plant-based diet. The way I was looking and feeling was enough for me to realize that the keto diet is NOT the optimal diet for my body at all.

If you eat 3 meals a day and you take 4 hours between meals, no snacks between meals, you give your body the opportunity to become more insulin sensitive. And if you stop eating 3 to 4 hours before you go to bed it will help you to fall asleep quicker and have better sleep. Also the best breakfast to break-fast after sleep is high protein and moderate fat with no to near zero carbohydrates a little high fibrous food like berries or fruit is fine to mix in because the fiber helps block the absorption of the fructose in them (which turns into glucose in the body).",@drewzimm4003,UCgIg9x9WzGRpPoCugCxSoKQ,0,2025-03-03T16:47:14Z,False,False,

In Georgia's favor, most of what she says is sensible (e.g., subtraction based diet, individualized, dangers of inflammatory foods, refined carbs, processed foods, sedentary lifestyle, stress), but I've got _beefs_ w/ a number of her comments in the first 30' alone: 

*9:12* - Became suspicious of a sales plug with her comment of experiencing results within _""days to weeks""_ if they have the _""Right information""_, which she clearly possesses and is going to spend the next hour telling us about. 

*12:30* - _""I was walking around with sub-optimal mental health"", ""faltering after lunch"", ""being completely spent [at end of day]"", ""being depressed in winter time""… ""All of these things we think of as really normal.""_ Because they ARE NORMAL. We live in a hyper-techno-industrialized, nature-deprived, corporate materialistic world that has us sat in front of screens 80% of the day, earning barely enough to afford shelter or health insurance. Winter is depressing b/c we're inside w/o sunlight. That's the main driver of the developed world's (UK & USA namely) mental health crisis, not whether you're eating too much fiber… 

*14:00* - following up to 9:12, she plugs her book and then claims a dietary panacea: ""I have a variety of strategies"", which ""resolved all of my physical issues and mental health issues"". Has anyone caught a scent of serpentine grease here?

*16:39* - _""it's not coming from saturated fat … or cholesterol""_. There's about a zillion studies over the past 50 years linking saturated fat and LDL cholesterol to chronic cardiovascular disease. Go right now to the NIH website and type in ""saturated fat"" or ""Cholesterol"" and have a nice swim in about one million pages of international research on their nutritional affects upon cardiovascular health, BMI, COPD etc. 

*20:40* - _""Anti-oxidant strategy doesn't work""_… really? That's what anti-oxidants do: capture free radicals. Of course if you have so much inflammation / oxidative stress, they'd probably be neutralized, but that's unfair to say it _""doesn't work""_.

*28:08* - what's causing _""chemical imbalances in brain""_ (i.e., of monoamines, GABA, glutamate)? Answer: _""Inflammation and oxidative stress"", and then ""all kinds of things go wrong depending on who you are ... you might develop Alzheimer's, ADHD, depression, cardiovascular disease""_, and they are all due to a _""metabolic malfunction""_ according to Georgia Ede. If that were the case, then why have cardiovascular diseases and cancer EXPLODED in the late 20th century, but were mysteriously absent before then? Most of the world was eating grains, rice, pulses back in those days. Why was the rate of obesity and heart disease so low? Why do the blue zone inhabitants of Okinawa and Southern Europe, who eat loads of starchy carbs and fibers daily, live to 100+ years, in good mental and physical health? Why in the China Study do villages unequivocally correlate cardiovascular disease w/ cancer? Sure, inflammation causes big problems, but so does all the plaque (i.e., fat & cholesterol) in your arteries, which tends to get lodged in your brain... It's called an aneurysm.

*Somewhere* - she said something about fiber being useless. There were at least 18 Meta-analyses showing statistical significance for fiber intake and decreases in all-cause mortality. You cannot compete with this level of data and international research.

The lady explained what a ketogenic diet is in response toy your suggestion that perhaps a calorie controlled diet might have the same effect and you then say well may be a Mediterranean diet might have the same effect.No,no,no,no,no. The ketogenic diet replicates fasting whilst allowing a food intake AND the lack of sugar/starch/glucose reduces insulin, the fat storage hormone, AND it produces ketones which supply a cleaner energy for the brain. As she said , the diet has to allow you to reach the fat burning point at which ketones are produced. The other diets don’t do this because they still have sugars/starches/glucose in them albeit at a different level to that of the standard western diet.

The Ayahuasca, the Peyote, and Shroom ceremonies MADE THINGS INFINITELY WORSE. 
As an Ultra Spiritual, Anti Big Pharma, Anti Big Med, WuWu Santa Fe Massage Therapist I TRIED EVERY HERBAL, NON DRUG OPTION KNOWN TO MAN.
NOTHING WORKED.
Then I went to a head doc, whom I met at an Ayahuasca Ceremony.
Two days after starting on Lithium for BP1 I WAS BETTER, WAY BETTER, Even Somewhat Functional. 
A few moments after ingesting prescribed Ritalin I COULD THINK AGAIN. MY BRAIN STARTED WORKING AGAIN. Everything they say about prescribed amphetamines and ADHD - IS TRUE. I can take amphetamine and SLEEP. Thats not a typo.

I was on Disability due to psychiatric issues. I was living on next to no money. One payday high fat ground beef was on super sale so I bought 60 pounds of put it in my freezer. At this juncture I was CLUELESS about the Carnivore Diet or KETO. 

Three days into eating nothing but High Fat Beef, Tons of SALT, & Water - NOTHING MORE. (POOR BOY MEALS… LOL..) I NO LONGER NEEDED THE RITALIN AS MY BRAIN’S MEMORY WAS WORKING AGAIN. On week two, I tossed the Lithium too, coz it felt like I didnt need it.

I went to massage school and know how the body works. That said I started supplementing according to the Body Builders. Weight Lifters and people with Adult ADHD follow the EXACT SAME PROTOCOLS. Body Builders also NEED MAX DOPAMINE (so they can lift that 800 pounds). ADHD is Dopamine Deficiency. 

So eventually doing Carnivore wasnt giving me enough DOPAMINE. 
The Body Builders use Non Amphetamine, Non Addictive,  Russian Prescription Nootropic  Dopamine Agonizing Brain Repairing SMART DRUGS. DOPAMINE TO THE MAX. (Like Bromantane - the stuff that got the Russians kicked out of the Olympics a dozen times.)  Whats good for the MUSCLES IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN.

Seven years of USELESS, ULTRA SEVERE SUFFERING over a SUPER LAME - ANTI BIG PHARMA/ ANTI BIG MED IDEALISM. (SO I COULD PROVE EXACTLY WHAT - TO EXACLY WHO?)

So guess how it plays when I shared that I found a very functional NON BIG PHARMA alternative for mental illness? My LMT massage therapist friends, & literally coffee shops full of anti big med idealist in Santa Fe? 
They all smiled and looked thrilled, until I told them that EATING 90 POUNDS OF HIGH FAT BEEF PLUS SALT AND WATER - NOTHING MORE - CURED MY MENTAL ILLNESSES… LOL…. 

INSTANTLY I WAS ONCE AGAIN - THE LEPER…. 
So I could prove Exactly What to Exactly Who?

I still love using herbs, just NOT FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS OR LIFE THREATENING.

Low fat so called healthy foods are loaded with sugar and empty calories full of starch).  Toxic prescription drugs.  They may be needed in mental health at times.     You can read and learn and I find these type of videos offer so much help in explaining.. Normal health GPS are just about symptoms and tabs that don't solve the real problem.  I do believe food is your medicine. Eat as natural as you can. ..Unbelievable this processed food with the amount of  sugar added and processed seed oils. It has also always puzzled me when they say saturated meat is bad.  The animals who are made up of this bad fat, they don't eat any fat, they eat mostly grass. Your body makes it's own.  We can make and store visceral fat through our body eating processed sugar. We turn sugar into fat. They don't take into account when doing the cholesterol test that this type of fat would obviously be bad.  Whereas eating healthy with natural fats would surely make a difference. It's just statins for Cholesterol without looking into anything when it goes over a number that they have altered just by the average of an unhealthy population through damaging foods.  They add this sugar and empty white starch to make people eat more.  It's addictive and causes insulin resistance.  This makes you hungry all the time and makes it impossible to lose any weight.

One thing that I do not understand is how the work of Dr. William Davis of Wheat Belly fame is not ever referenced by anyone. Over 10 years ago he exposed all the dangers of modern wheat, the addictive qualities, the affect of wheat on mental illness, all of the autoimmune conditions it causes, etc. etc. . He doesn't promote it anymore, and people think I'm nuts when I try to explain to them the real reason why going on carnivore got rid of their IBS, for example. I know a guy who told me that, and I asked him if he is taking any supplements, because there a lot of nutrients that you can't get from just eating meat, and he says ""no, I've done my research"". He's fine now because his IBS is gone, but I think he is in for long-term health problems from all of the nutrients that he is not getting, and I'm sure that long term carnivore probably does bad things to the gut microbiome. Sorry, I got off of the subject. Anyhow, a lot of the benefits that people obtain from keto are not just related to blood sugar, they are because of all of the bad things wheat does to us. There are lots of vids on You Tube of Dr. Davis lecturing about this, if you haven't seen them, please do. Another important person in this space that needs more awareness is Dr. Thomas Seyfried and his cancer related research that relates to Keto. If you or somebody you care about has cancer, you MUST become aware of what he has to say, it is very important. I first became aware of his work from an interview that he did on this channel. This video is going into my list of important health info also, I think I need to look at more vids from this channel, the 2 I have seen so far are excellent.",@ryanjones4150,UC_B0_s9P_YhQBaVaxR_Q32A,0,2025-02-23T15:33:28Z,False,False,

Clinically I’ve noticed those who have mild Anxiety type symptoms may have an issue with psyllium due to motility issues. Those who tend to worry excessively or have sleep issues tent to have interruptions in motility and therefore psyllium may bind them up.

Let’s look at my late father. He lived to 98 years old. His diet, which I prepared for him was cheerios with coffee at noon with sourdough toast/butter. Then a dinner of a small salad with baked chicken, fresh cooked hamburger or steak in virgin oil (not the expensive ones) and some green beans. Never corn or carrots. Snack at 7-8 pm of coffee and 2 cookies. He smoked till his 50’s and drank a little till his 60’s. No super greens, and organic was not a part of every day discourse. I do not advocate this eating pattern, it is just my observation. Experts don’t make money on telling you to pick your genes, therefore parents.

Once I reached a certain point though (159 lbs for me) I just automatically stopped losing weight and even gained back a few pounds so I look a little healthier than when I first lost 55 lbs. in 6 months.

If the goal is not to lose so much weight, I would play with upping the proteins some and reducing the fat a little.  Of course if you are doing it for mental health, there are limits to how much you can lower the fat ratio without it affecting you.

He still needed medication, but the difference was shocking. He was able to go to school and do normal activities. 

It occurs to me that perhaps the artificial colors/flavors were a factor, but by cutting them (esp. in the 70s & 80s), you eliminate most highly processed foods and are left with what likely was a much more ketogenic diet. He ate no candy, but did have things like dried dates as a treat, for example. More meat, fish, whole vegetables, but he also had carbs like potatoes and pasta.

Especially when the comments are more opinions than scientific truths proven by multiple RCTs. And of course the method is very unfair.

So DOAC wrote ""Dietary fiber is essential for digestive health and overall well being"". As fibers are indigestible, I want to know which studies proved that adding indigestible fibers to our food could help digestion, and how they could do that. To me it's a bit like saying that running with an extra load could help to run faster.

DOAC wrote also ""It slows down the digestion and absorption of macronutrients through various mechanisms"" If it slows down digestion how could it help the digestion? It seems quite contradictory to what was previously stated. And yes, fibers slow down the absorption of carbohydrates: it is certainly a good thing when you eat too much of them but, as Georgia Ede noted it, a better way to avoid glucose and insulin spikes after a meal would be simply to reduce carbs intake. It's a bit like what we say about alcohol, drink your beer/wine with food rather than on an empty stomach. But preferably and for health purposes, it is better to simply avoid alcohol.

DOAC concluded ""It also helps improve digestive issues like constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome"". Just the fact that fiber could treat both diarrhea and constipation is already suspicious. I'd rather say show me the data. Paul Mason for example, showed a RCT on constipation where the participants on a 0-fiber diet had far better outcomes than those eating fibers. It is a bit more logical as I don’t see why adding more bulk to the food could improve transit except, maybe, if your bowel has some intolerance with a particular and irritant fiber so that it wants to dump it as fast as possible. In that case it could help a bit with constipation but at the price of damage to the gut lining.

Personally, having tested for years both a plant-based diet with a lot of fiber and an animal-based diet very low in fiber I can say that I'm now far better on a ketogenic/carnivore diet with almost no fiber. I guess that legumes, nuts and FODMAPs weren't great for me. From what I watched and read I'm certainly not an outlier as many people who transitioned to a carnivore diet have seen their gut health improve. People interested could search Kent Carnivore channel and see what happens when people have gut issues and, very sadly, rely too much on opinion-based advice rather than on science. 

It is a terrifying thing to think that people who have gut issues are encouraged to eat even more fibers while the fibers are, very often, what caused their issues. These people could perfectly lose their colon in the process because they ate these ""healthy"" fibers supposed to “improve digestive issues like constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome”.  

Maybe after all is it the aim? If you have colon issues, eat more fiber, damage your colon, have your colon replaced with a colostomy bag: no more colon issues.",@Noegzit,UC-A5ZsaTAHZ8E7b4tzJDeng,1,2025-02-16T15:06:09Z,False,False,

They are lipoproteins (low density and high density lipoproteins).  The cholesterol found in both are EXACTLY the same molecule and that molecule is extremely crucial for many things in our bodies.  There are however good and bad low density liporoteins (LDLs) and this has mostly to do with how long they hang around in your blood.  The longer they stay in your blood the smaller they get as they keep dropping off cholesterol and triglycerides (and other fat based things like vitamins) to cells where needed and because they circulate in your blood longer they get glycated and oxidized.  It's these small damaged lipoproteins that get picked up by macrophages (the garbage scoopers in our blood) probably because they are deleterious and the liver doesn't want them, and end up in plaque in our arteries.  Regular, healthy, larger LDLs aren't found in plaque as they get picked up by the liver to be recycled rather quickly in comparison to the very small LDLs.  So yes, LDLs matter but mostly because of the situation we create that determines how long they stick around in our blood.  Guess which situations carnivores and whole food omnivores tend to have?

I was asking the question because I once upon a time learned that it is the balance between LDL/HDL that mattered most. And that a mostly meat diet increased LDL by a lot. 

But I just checked a bit and it seems that this idea is now outdated. 

I have not heard so much about the different LDL-types before and I also don't know what a typical carnivore or whole food diet contributes to (feel free to elaborate). 

So I will need to check that out. 

What I am mostly curious about right now is:
-What drawbacks does a keeto diet have. 

Stuff that we typically hear as, ""Carnivore/keeto is bad for your cholesterol"" ""To much red meat increases the risk for cancer"" - you know all those kind of examples. 

The reason why I am curious about this topic in general is that lately I´ve heard more and more about the issues connected to Insulin overall.

The reason of my worries is that , a severe ketogenic diet can potentially lead to muscle loss, particularly if not managed properly with adequate protein intake and resistance training, as the body may start breaking down muscle tissue for energy when carbohydrates are severely restricted; this is especially concerning when combined with a significant calorie deficit.

GKI values approaching 1.0 are considered potentially most therapeutic ( in my view the longer you be in this state after achieving your goals the higher the negative impact like muscle mass loss) . 

A GKI of 6–9 indicates a low level of ketosis, which is ideal for weight loss and maintaining health 
MA GKI of 3–6 indicates a moderate level of ketosis, which is ideal for people with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, or obesity",@abdulnaas,UC5r4v-B7GasNWFQO4iYddCw,0,2025-02-16T10:17:41Z,False,False,

Meat takes normally 48 to 72 hours to move through the intestines, especially if one eats rare cooked meat! One experiment one can do to mimic what happens in intestines of someone who eats mostly meat, is to take a piece of rare cooked meat, place it in sun, which mimics the temperature inside the intestines, watch as to what happens to that piece of meat! It rottens , and that’s exactly what happens in intestines! You will harbor all negative bacteria harboring an environment which will lead to cancer!

It is extremely rare that a psychiatrist will even slightly contemplate diet over mental health. I observe that Dr Ede has used her competence, confront and care to research further beyond her original medical and mental education on how diet effects the mind. I think more psychiatrists and psychologists need to take note here that prior to prescribing any medications to anyone  ( adults and children ) they should be correctly educated in food and nutrition like Dr Ede here and therefore encourage a correct diet to their patients first. Once a person gets on those medications it is near impossible for them to get off of them safely - the withdrawal is horrendous. those drugs are extremely mind altering and not only cause suicidal thoughts but also harm to others - all of those school shootings are a 100% fact that the shooter was heavily effected by some sort of psychiatric medication.",@17RBP,UCLje9dxCnG7o8fxwK99vFFw,0,2025-02-06T16:55:14Z,False,False,

Otherwise she would not put out those myths like seed oils causing inflammation, which could not be experiementally verified, study after study. I don't want to doubt all those reports of people feeling better on a keto diet. People like to think in absolutes, glorify their approach and demonize the rest, but I'm starting to think that either what is most helpful for the brain in the short term is very different from what is most helpful for health in the long term, which is what all those nutritional studies focus on, or there is some very significant individual variability, which is not considered in studies, which only show the average. In total, there are annectodes saying animal-based low carb diets dramatically improve mental and physical health (even though the question often remains compared to which diet exactly), while longterm studies point in the opposite direction. My conclusion is, a ketogenic diet seems to act like a reset for the body, especially for people who have developed several intolerances, which allows them to recover and rebalance, but in the long term, a plant-based whole food diet remains the healthier option. It's similar to the situation with fiber - there is positive association between health in general and gut health specifically and yet, for people with significant existing gut issues, avoiding fiber completely seems to be the most effective thing they can do... until the body has re-established balance and can tolerate them again. What's very clear is, a diet high in fast carbs is never a good idea.",@fidrewe99,UCT51C8C7zCfLXvF8entnM3A,0,2025-02-06T12:26:14Z,False,False,

She did say that often, people need to be in a good place by being on a medication to stabilize their symptoms before they have the ability to make these changes - imagine telling someone with full blown ADHD to get a sleep routine, stop chasing dopamine by eating junk food, and to get an exercise routine.

When you shed the food addictions which are bred into the standard American diet you’re not a slave to eating…
Sometimes when I reach my feeding window, usually around 5 to 7pm, if I don’t feel like preparing a meal, I’ll just skip it til the next day…life is simple if you only eat one meal a day and you don’t have hunger pangs. Also there is no waste in a carnivore diet. If I prepare a couple pounds of meat and maybe a half dozen eggs, and  I’m unable to eat it all, I throw it in the fridge and it’s good tomorrow.

It is an adaptive metabolic system, responding not just to the quantity of energy consumed but, more importantly, to the quality and type of nutrients. Especially in a keto lifestyle, calories mean absolutely nothing – what matters is how the body reacts to the source of those calories. 100 calories from sugar trigger a completely different insulin and metabolic response than 100 calories from healthy fats or protein. Still think a ""caloric deficit"" is the ultimate key?

If I had to advice anyone on how to get out of their miserable state, I would recomnend start fasting for 10days, meanwhile prepare  and switch to Keto than AND start moving everyday - leave your house early in the morning, put on a cool podcast and have a steady walk for at least 1,5 hours and 10k steps. (Our do it 1h before bedtime) 

Do this for 30 days and than check your mental and physical condition again! 

I‘ll promise you will be absolutly surprised by yourself.

Disorders like bipolar and ADHD have a multitude of factors. Genetics are certainly a significant factor, but there are numerous other factors like diet, lifestyle, environment, stress, microbiome status, etc. that all interplay with genetics to result in how much mood and cognition issues manifest in any given individual.

It's not a binary ""you either have it or you don't"" situation. You certainly can develop issues over time that become diagnosable as a specific disorder.

I was diagnosed with asthma at 15, but back then never had any issues. I didn't even notice it, when I was fit. I mainly think, because I was an athlete back then, working out 6/7 days of the week. I had heavy problems with breathing though, whenever I had a cold. And I get the cold quite often, usually a couple a times a year. then I would be caughing very bad, and couldn't sleep, because I was getting no air. Since I am about 18 I feel the symptoms when I am not sick too. I was still working out, but less than half as much. Since about 16 I am taking strong medication through an inhalator everyday. I don't really have breathing difficulties, but my chest feels more closed and manly my doctors telling me that I need to take them to manage my asthma. The biggest problem I have is at night, because I have a dust allergy too, so if I am sleeping in a bed, that doesn't have fresh linen, I can't breathe properly. With 18 I had also started smoking wheat with tobacco. When I was only smoking pure, especially my first time, I could breath so deep, like I had never experienced before. I got addicted and stopped when I was 21. Because I have also house dust mites allergy, washing my bed linen frequently helps a lot. I know for sure that working out is helping tremendously! Also mild exercise outside, beeing in forests. I am on keto since 2.5 weeks. I feel great.

She spoke about the harmful effects of antibiotics on the human body but seemed to overlook how meat products are often saturated with these very chemicals.

It felt so frustrating to get all these seemingly contradictive advices everywhere that it feels like a relief to get explanations that tie fragments of knowledge and personal experience together.
For example about the definition of a ketogenic diet: that it doesn't mean that you're  not allowed to eat carbs, but that it is about wheter the diet gets you into ketosis. Which makes the information out there about the ketogenic diet way more compatible with the information out there about an animal based diet, which includes fruits, dairy and honey, and with my personal experience and preferences. I also like the nuance regarding the types of food sources and regarding the health and activity of the individual. And that getting into ketosis is about the right glucose levels, insulin levels and depleting the glucose storage in the liver. So the fact that your glucose levels are in good range doesn't necessarily mean that you are in ketosis and thus in fat burning mode. I also learned that there are gradations of ketosis, that you can switch in and out there, and that that might be more or less comfortable depending on your health status. Also the information about people healing from all kinds of health problems is very inspiring.
This gives me hope and inspiration to keep searching for ways to heal. Also it reassures me that I should trust the signals of my body more. Because many of this I already started to understand intuitively, but it's challenging not to get anxious and too restrictive after absorbing information that seems to contradict personal experience. In this context I also like the distinction between on the one hand aknowledging the biological facts that apply to everyone and on the other hand regarding the personal configuration.",@Jordy_NL,UCu8V3EjdIupQA9irwVtR-yQ,2,2025-01-25T11:06:59Z,False,False,

Carnivore is the easiest if you can find a menu that you suits you.  Stick to it and keto flu will pass in 2 days.  You will be fooled by Keto Snacks and how they count Carbs.  Total Carbs, Added Carbs, Added Sugar.  The only one to look at is Total Carbs.  Keto diet is 20 grams per day maximum.  Some nuts like Pecans and Macadamia may work as a snack, but I find One nut begets a bag.  Those FAT Bomb carnivore snacks can remind you how great a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup can be and there goes the entire box.  Eat often, Add lots of real Butter, watch out for Dairy.  I have a love/hate relationship with Coffee, Splenda and Lactose free half and half.  You Body will find Carbs if they exist and you'll crave them.

The professor laughed in my face and said that’s not possible. I shrugged it off but I knew it was possible because I had lived experience on how diet directly affected my brain, and at some point in time people will wake up and realise. 

I have ADHD and wasn’t medicated until adulthood. The only time in my teenage years that I did well in school and didn’t have any behavioural issues was when I strictly ate only animal protein, veggies (no starchy veg), berries and nuts. I was 💯 in ketosis and I thrived. Unfortunately, I got a bit too skinny and my mum made me eat all the other crap again and things went downhill from there. Medicated now and I generally stay away from grains, processed foods and table sugar (apart from the odd treat) - they make me feel ill, give me brain fog and make my ADHD worse. Life is infinitely better 😊 Perhaps I am just really sensitive but grains and processed foods really don’t sit well with my body and my brain at all.",@lovealwayslucy,UCJE9De9x0_uzn6XOWRh4XdQ,0,2025-01-24T02:17:21Z,False,False,

- No, dietary fiber is not essential for digestive health nor overall well-being.
- Why would I want to slow down my digestion?
- The only anecdote I've ever heard about fiber and digestions is that a decrease improves those three symptoms.

You should perhaps take a look at (I think the only?) experiment on fiber and constipation, bleeding, bloating, etc. You'd be very surprised.

I was struggling with my symptoms for years. I didn't want to take medications. Doctors were saying its nothing wrong with ne. As a Pharmacist  I knew I shouldn't feel like  that. For years I was trying different approaches as I found ketogenic diet. I absolutely LOVE IT!!! this diet improved all my mental struggles like depression, anxiety, panic attacks,  lack of energy,ect. It also improved my metabolic health: ibs, sibo, pre-diabetic stage, funny allergies, ect. And I am loosing my weight as well. I am not tired all days, I am full of energy, I am emotionally stable.

How can we all become carnivore without intensive farming and so destroying the planet and ourselves; 3)it is not true that there are no diets on which we have tenths of years of data.....we have a diet called Mediterranean diet which has been studied (collecting data,) in Europe since the 50s; 4)finally the Mediterranean diet has exactly the benefit she attributes to the keto diet....which is to kerp insulin in control. The problem is that many people seem not to be clear on what the Mediterranean diet really is....at least the authentic ancient one that we have been following for centuries ....not the one media talk about.

Honestly, I had gotten so tired of all the Keto talk and anything surrounding this topic. I myself went keto for about a year and noticed several benefits like energy, weightloss, clarity etc.  I have studied wellness my whole life without a degree to show. Just a personal interest. However, this past year my health has taken a toll like I have never experienced before.  I have gained almost 60 pounds in less than 9 months, debilitating joint and muscle pain, strange UTIs I have never had before, constant allergic reactions and dermatitis, severe restless sleep, insomnia, fatigue, GI issues to name a few. On top of this my mental health has absolutely tanked. I have had OCD/Anxiety/Adhd for years but now it seems almost unbearable. I have a literal pharmacy in my closet from all of my prescribed meds.... I have been to urgent care, doctors appointments, and CVS pharmacy more times this past year then in my whole life. To be honest, I know my eating turned worse during a very stressful time but to amass this list of health issues in such a short time is mind blowing. I have tried low carb and stuff but end up giving up as everything seems to be such a battle in modernity. I just said to my partner I am so done with keto talks, there is nothing else to learn..sure it helps some lose some weight and gain energy....yada yada yada but for me it seems pointless. I literally have so many appointments coming up to address various concerns and even I know Pharma isnt the answer. But after years of various supplements, health plans, diet changes, exercise, therapy, etc....one gives up. I am a YOUNG 43 year old woman in Perimenopause and I am almost disabled. I can barely work my part time service industry job and spend the rest of the time recovering from it. I almost didnt listen because I figured its just another Academic regurgitating same stuff and to some degree is true but I think I turned onto this podcast just in time to make a serious change back into Keto full force to see if I can heal. I am slowly losing my life and vision for any future and this podcast has turned this around for me. Thank you Steven for this interview with Dr. Ede and thanks for all to reading. Let us all be filled with health, knowledge and intention to treat our bodies with the utmost respect. Our whole paradigm needs to shift in society.

I KNOW ALL THE HERBS.
I’ve experienced more alternative treatments than most humans even realize exist.
THAT SAID: They all feel dam good, but dont work. Straight up.
Due to being scared to go to the REAL DOCTOR for a decade, I ended up NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK due to S1-L5 & L5-L4 having ground the discs DOWN TO NOTHING. I have hi res MRI’s of my lumbar spine. PICTURES SAY THE TRUTH. Do to all that anti real medicine action my lower back is so bad that they I am no longer qualified for Disc Replacement Surgery. CHRONIC NERVE PAIN AND DISTAL NEUROPATHY IN MY FEET, CONSTANTLY. Guess what got me back on my feet in less than 24 hours! NASTY OLE BIG PHARMA MEDICINE DID, THATS WHAT. Acupuncture helps for about an hour, ditto with chiropractic. Both of those modalities are very pricey too. The big pharma meds COST ME NOTHING - thank you Mr. Obama for Obama Care,
Well medicaid wont cover the KETAMINE PAIN CREAM that I rub on my lumbar spine to KILL the disabling Neuropathy in my feet.
I’m not done….
I was so scared of the REAL DOCTORS that I was scared to go see a HEAD DOC therefore haf no clue that I had BIPOLAR1 MANIA NON STOP FOR 7 YEARS. Bipolar Mania means CONSTANTLY ENGAGING IN RISKY BEHAVIOR. Such as, riding my go fast titanium bike WITH NO HELMET, EVER. Yeah so you ANTI REAL DOCTOR WHACK JOBS had me to scared to see a REAL DOCTOR. So the bike crash at high speed gave me a TBI and Adult ADHD so bad that I was ready to jump off a G.Dam building just for some relief.  (note NEVER DO AYAHUASCA OR ANY SACRED MEDICINES FOR MENTAL ILNESS, IT MAKES THEM EXPONENTIALLY WORSE - for 3 years in fact.)
So the BIG PHARMA LITIUM THAT I REQUESTED WORKED IN TWO DAY, NO MORE WHACK JOB MANIA PRETTY MUCH INSTANTLY. ALSO PRESCRIBED AMPHETAMINE DOES WORK FOR SEVERE ADHD, ITS ACTUALLY THE BEST MEDICINE FOR ADHD. ADHD SO BAD THAT I COULD NO LONGER READ, COZ YOU CANT EFFING READ WHEN YOU HAVE NO WORKING MEMORY. YOU CAN ONLY REREAD THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OVER AND OVER AGAIN COZ YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST READ WHEN YOU LACK WORKING MEMORY.
Furthermore. That BAD CAR ACCIDENT…… THANK GOD FOR BIG PHARMA ADRENALINE THAT KEPT ME ALIVE LONG ENOUGH FOR THE HELICOPTER TO LAND ME AT ER WHERE THE VERY SMART REAL DOCTORS SAVED MY LIFE.

THANK GOD FOR REAL DOCTORS AND REAL MEDS.

Herbs are for VERY MINOR SH_T, NOT REAL ILLNESS OR INJURY.

I also self prescribed Russian Prescription Nootropic Smart Drugs to rotate with the Merkin big pharma Ritalin. I do take two herbs for insulin resistance.

People with brains can read about the Merkin prescription meds BEFORE they take them and decide if the bad affects are worth the trade off for the good affects.

Just like herbs, NOT ALL REAL MEDICINE WORKS FOR EVERY PERSON, coz THATS HOW SCIENCE WORKS, ITS A WORK IN MOTION.

TBI & CHRONIC ADULT ADHD DUE TO FOLLOWING THE WHACK JOB ANTI BIG MED IDEALISM……

Many animals slaughtered so you can eat your salad. Sad.

I truly appreciate the animal that gives it's life so that I can live the best life i can.  Since I cut down on my carbs and started eating a meat/fat dense diet, I feel 30 years younger!  No exaggerating either! Off 5 prescriptions. Reversed type2 , and high blood pressure. Aches and pains are gone. They only return if i cheat and eat too many carbs. But once the sugar and subsequent insulin go down in the blood, the aches go away again.  Our bodies are amazing and we aren't suppose to get sick in our 30's-50's. We should be feeling good into old age and peacefully passing in our sleep. Not sick and suffering on a death bed. That's the truth.  Don't need fancy pills or substances. Maybe some electrolytes after you start urinating it all out along with the inflammation which is the cause of the water weight and the chronic illnesses of today. Keep the insulin low, and your body will automatically start letting go of the fluid that is being retained.  That feels great, as long as you keep your electrolytes up.",@dawnapm,UCJFdufZF4pUvauE4w_ZckNg,1,2025-04-21T18:02:13Z,False,True,Ugy5hSCgpLgiCntpLsh4AaABAg

I didn't take any medication for my depression. I had thought about it a couple times but I decided against it every single time.

That first year I started Keto? I went dirty keto. I ate mainly McDoubles from McDonald's without the bun or the ketchup, 6 to 8 per meal, 2 meals per day, 12 to 16 total per day, most days. Without the bun and ketchup, you still have 2 thin beef patties, 1 slice of american cheese, a dollop of mustard, diced dehydrated onions, and a couple slices of cheap pickles per McDouble.
Sometimes I'd switch the McDonald's for different restaurant's foods which would consist of more, bigger, beef patties, cheese, eggs, sour cream, bacon, cucumber, avocado, pico de gallo, and guacamole.

That sort of thing for 3 months was enough for the depression to lift.

These days I eat even more strictly, but still dirty by way of mostly from fast food and restaurants. Mostly eat beef patties. I still have bacon, avocado, and onions. I occasionally have cheese or garlic, but both hurt my joints as it turns out and so I try not to indulge too often.
I cut out pico de gallo and guacamole because both are made with lime juice and limes give people margarita burns and that would sabotage my sunbathing.

All-in-all... best health of my life that I've ever been, shockingly.

Hi @lanagrahamntx, your story is so inspiring! I can completely relate – in late 2024, I started my own keto journey, and it completely transformed my life. 🌱✨

During one of the hardest times of my life – balancing my master’s thesis, going through a breakup, moving, and taking care of my child – I still managed to stay on track. The changes I experienced were incredible: I lost 8 kg (about 17.6 lbs) in 21 days, felt more energetic than ever, and my emotional balance improved so much.

Keto not only helped me physically but also gave me the mental clarity and strength to navigate that challenging period. Supplements and proper preparation were key to making the transition smoother, and I can’t recommend enough taking time to prepare before diving in. 🥗💪

If anyone here is curious about starting keto and needs some friendly guidance (I’m not a coach, just someone who’s been through it and loves helping others 😊), feel free to check out my channel. You’ll find my email there if you’d like to connect and get some support to get started!

If I could do it during such a tough time, I know you can too! 💛 #KetoJourney #Transformation",@Treealth,UCB1deJVbas_zIjeZlhxr6bA,1,2025-01-20T20:41:45Z,False,False,

I was still doing keto, and started doing the shots, but my weight loss immediately stopped. My food noise actually came back and did the opposite of what everybody was saying that the shots were doing for them. It totally threw off my mental state, and I got very depressed and started eating carbohydrates again. I've only gained back about ten of the pounds that I had lost and I had lost seventy pounds altogether. I'm about to start doing keto again, because it was the best thing for my body. I cannot believe how much no longer consuming food chemicals and eating very clean and very low carbs had done for my health.

### **Introduction: The Power of Nutrition for Mental Health**
The ketogenic diet has gained significant attention in recent years, not only as a tool for weight loss but also as a potential therapy for mental health disorders. Scientific studies and practical experiences reveal impressive results:

- **43% of patients with chronic mental illnesses** such as bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophrenia achieved clinical remission through the ketogenic diet.
- **64% of participants were able to reduce or discontinue their psychiatric medications.**
- Many people report **noticeable reductions in anxiety** within just three days to three weeks of starting the diet.

These findings suggest that the ketogenic diet profoundly impacts the brain and its underlying biochemical processes. But how exactly does it work, and how can it be tailored to individual needs?

---

### **1. Scientific Foundations of the Ketogenic Diet**

#### **a. What Happens in the Brain?**
The ketogenic diet fundamentally changes the brain's energy supply. It reduces inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance—three primary causes of many mental health disorders. At the same time, it improves the balance of key neurotransmitters such as:

- **Serotonin** (mood),
- **Dopamine** (motivation and reward),
- **GABA** (calming effects), and
- **Glutamate** (learning and memory).

By shifting to fat as the brain’s primary energy source (ketosis), the brain is supplied with ketones, which are burned more efficiently and ""cleanly"" than glucose. This allows for sustainable healing and regeneration of brain cells.

#### **b. The Role of Ketosis**
Ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body converts fat into ketones, which serve as an alternative energy source. To achieve this state, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Low glucose and insulin levels:** Achieved by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake.
2. **Depletion of glycogen stores in the liver.**
3. **Production of ketones:** These can be measured through blood tests (e.g., beta-hydroxybutyrate levels above 0.5 mmol/L).

In ketosis, healing and maintenance processes in the brain are activated, which are less active in the normal metabolic state.

---

### **2. The Ketogenic Diet as a Therapy for Mental Illness**

#### **a. Study Results**
A study involving 31 patients with treatment-resistant mental illnesses showed remarkable outcomes:

- The patients had been symptomatic for an average of 10 years and were taking five psychiatric medications on average.
- After starting a mild ketogenic diet in a hospital setting, **all patients improved**, and 43% achieved full remission.
- **Metabolic Health:** All patients also showed improvements in their metabolic markers, which is rare in conventional psychiatric care.

#### **b. Challenges and Safety Considerations**
Transitioning to a ketogenic diet can initially be stressful, as it affects brain chemistry and blood sugar levels. Medical supervision is crucial to avoid side effects such as:

- Changes in blood sugar,
- Blood pressure fluctuations, and
- Potential interactions with medications.

---

### **3. Personalizing Nutrition: A Key to Success**

#### **a. Core Principles of Nutrition**
A successful dietary strategy is based on three fundamental principles:

1. **Nourish:** Provide all essential nutrients through whole foods, especially animal-based products.
2. **Protect:** Exclude harmful ingredients like refined carbohydrates and inflammatory vegetable oils.
3. **Energize:** Ensure stable glucose and insulin levels to provide the brain with long-term, clean energy.

#### **b. Personalization Through Trial-and-Error**
Not every diet works the same for everyone. Factors such as age, activity level, existing health conditions, and personal preferences play a role. Adjustments can be made by:

- **Tracking symptoms** to monitor the effects of specific foods.
- **Metabolic testing** to determine individual carbohydrate tolerance.
- **Considering allergies and food intolerances.**

### **4. Practical Tips for Starting the Ketogenic Diet**

#### **a. Preparation**
- **Gradual Transition:** Begin by moderately reducing carbohydrate intake to minimize side effects like the ""keto flu.""
- **Electrolyte Supplementation:** Magnesium, potassium, and sodium can help prevent symptoms like headaches and fatigue.

#### **b. Foods Included in the Ketogenic Diet**
- **Allowed:** Meat, fish, eggs, non-starchy vegetables, healthy fats (e.g., avocado, coconut oil).
- **To Avoid:** Sugar, refined carbohydrates, ultra-processed foods, vegetable oils.

#### **c. Monitoring**
- Use **ketone tests** (blood or urine tests) to ensure you are in ketosis.
- Keep a food journal to track progress and identify potential issues.

---

### **5. Scientific Controversies and Misconceptions**

#### **a. Is the Ketogenic Diet Sustainable?**
The long-term effects of the ketogenic diet are not yet fully understood. However, numerous reports highlight significant health improvements, including:

- **Weight loss,**
- **Stable blood sugar levels,** and
- **Improved mental clarity.**

#### **b. Myths About Fiber**
The belief that fiber is essential for gut health is increasingly being questioned. A ketogenic diet can provide similar benefits to fiber through the production of butyrate (a byproduct of ketosis).

---

### **6. Specific Benefits of the Ketogenic Diet**

#### **a. Anxiety and Depression**
- **Rapid Effects:** Many people report significant reductions in anxiety within weeks.
- **Stress Hormone Regulation:** The diet lowers cortisol levels, which are often elevated in chronic stress and anxiety disorders.

#### **b. Food Addiction and Binge Eating**
- **Hormonal Stability:** The diet stabilizes insulin and appetite hormones, reducing cravings.
- **Better Control Over Temptations:** Many report thinking less about food and feeling full for longer periods.

#### **c. ADHD and Other Neurodivergent Disorders**
- **Link to Metabolic Health:** Studies show that insulin resistance and ADHD often occur together. The ketogenic diet may help alleviate symptoms by improving metabolic health.

---

### **7. Practical Challenges and Psychological Considerations**
Adopting the ketogenic diet involves more than dietary changes. Key challenges include:

- **Behavioral Adjustments:** Addressing emotional and psychological relationships with food is essential for long-term success.
- **Support Systems:** A team approach, including dieticians, prescribers, and therapists, can help individuals navigate the transition and sustain the diet.
- **Keto Flu:** Temporary symptoms like headaches and fatigue can occur during the initial adaptation phase but can be mitigated with proper planning and electrolyte supplementation.

---

### **Conclusion: A Revolutionary Approach to Mental Health**
The ketogenic diet is more than just a dietary trend—it offers a scientifically backed and transformative way to improve both mental and physical health. By reducing inflammation, stabilizing hormones, and providing clean energy sources for the brain, it can:

- Alleviate symptoms of chronic mental illnesses,
- Lower the risk of metabolic diseases, and
- Improve overall quality of life.

**Recommendation:** Anyone interested in trying the ketogenic diet should educate themselves thoroughly, personalize the approach, and ideally seek medical support. With the right strategy, this dietary approach can be a powerful intervention for both the body and mind.",@MrQuadcity,UCG9HRS5KUtWshdSyNxWsqRA,0,2025-01-20T17:17:59Z,False,False,

I've struggled most of my adult life with being overweight after giving birth to my son 16 years ago and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety soon after that. I also got horrible migraines starting in my late 20's. I've gone to many doctors who have tested my blood, find nothing, and proceed to give a number of different medications to help with my symptoms. This year Jan. 2025 I started the Keto diet as my last stitch effort to lose weight. Little did I know the benefits I would receive for my mental health! For almost two decades I have been on some heavy prescriptions for mental health. I have only been doing KETO for 3 weeks and I've starting cutting down on my meds, I'm losing weight, way less cravings, I sleep better, much better mood, more energy, way less headaches! I believe this is the answer to many of our physical and mental issues and EVERYONE should give it a good try and see what benefits they can receive. I know it's hard to take someone's advice these days, I was skeptical and I didn't want to make those ""hard changes"" of cutting out all the carbs, however I think KETO may saved my life! It's how our ancestors ate, it's natural. Once you see, you'll never go back. Get yourself into ketosis for a few weeks time and if it doesn't work you can stop, however I bet all bodies and minds improve as my did. This is the future of health!

I suggest to anyone to try at least 100 days in strict protocols to let our body properly adjust, and feel also check medically the difference then can stop anytime when not worthed. The key is doing it by discipline. Unfortunately many fail in discipline things.

""There is a considerable body of research suggesting that a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet is safe in individuals with moderately diminished kidney function, even in studies that had higher protein intake than what is recommended for kidney disease and diets that are not plant-based. The diet can be safely prescribed in patients with T2D (type 2 diabetes) for treating and remitting diabetes even if they have underlying stage 2 or 3 CKD (chronic kidney disease) or reduced kidney function. Beyond safety, mechanistic plausibility, preclinical data, and even some RCT studies suggest that carbohydrate-restricted diets may be beneficial in improving moderate kidney dysfunction and in reducing progression of CKD.",@GeorgiaEdeMD,UCtlGIM3YKoS4_YvFnw2WKrw,2,2025-01-20T01:43:55Z,False,True,UgyXe2QEHFS4xSfTtaV4AaABAg

That may (or may not) be the case, but putting that on the screen while your guest is presenting a contrary opinion is disrespectful. Also, how can you or anyone on your team make such a statement, much less present the statement as if it is the irrefutable. A back and forth discussion is desirable and part of the reason I love your channel. Pushing back on a statement you question is part of an effective interview. Even saying you disagree is perfectly acceptable. But this popping up on the screen while she was explaining was very off-putting.

I'm most certain that there is something in my genes that makes me stick to a vegetarian lifestyle.

I'm now nearing 30 and thankfully took matters into my own hands a few years back, starting out with cutting out gluten. I effectively gradually went on an elimination diet (the low-fodmap diet) to reduce the inflammation in my gut and treat my SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) as well as addressing the b12d that had resulted. It's a hard one to stick too, but its really helped. 

Turns out that it's effectively a keto-diet, and my intermittent fasting during the day was also putting me into ketosis.

The pharmaceutical companies, which are the major funding source for medical studies are not interested in funding those studies.  The few that are ongoing are fairly small and are being funded mostly by one philanthropic society (the Baszuki Group).  The ketogenic diet is being studied because there is a large signal from people trying it for mental health.  There is no large signal coming from something like the Plant Based diet so no one has any interested in wasting millions of dollars on it.  Considering the Plant Based diet has been around for a long time now and is more popular than the keto diet, if there was a significant signal, it would have been noticed by now.

That said, there is a small signal from just about every diet where people are switching from processed food to healthier whole food.  It's just not as significant as that coming from a whole food ketogenic diet.  I'd also like to remind everyone that a whole food, medical ketogenic diet can be done with an omnivore diet, carnivore diet or plant based diet.",@reinerschafer1708,UCVIPUsYikekbBZW84inmzCQ,0,2025-01-22T18:32:59Z,False,True,UgwtlV3OR2VWgPvi2th4AaABAg

Ketoacidosis occurs when your body cannot produce insulin, therefore cannot get glucose into your cells for fuel.  Since your cells are starving, your body frantically produces ketones in an effort to get fuel into your cells, but our bodies cannot work on ketones alone and in the end we end up with too many ketones and not enough glucose.  On a ketogenic diet, your body is still producing insulin and still getting glucose into your cells and there is no need for your body to produce the amount of ketones that would occur in ketoacidodis.  Like Dr. Ede said in the interview, our body's cells work on a hybrid of fuel.  Our cells for the most part prefer ketones over glucose but if we have high glucose in our blood it uses the glucose first in an effort to get the excess glucose out of the blood as too high glucose, along with high insulin, is detrimental to our health.",@reinerschafer1708,UCVIPUsYikekbBZW84inmzCQ,0,2025-01-19T05:02:57Z,False,True,UgyEBrrMwfuljUGaXG54AaABAg

Seems like the same logic that says male babies have no nerve endings and cant feel circumcision...even while seeing these infants go into shock, have a pain response and even pass out.

I knew it would temporarily work because I had been on the keto diet many times, but always fell off because of the variety of foods, and trying to keep track of macros sucks.  So I went carnivore 19 months ago, lost 85 lbs so far, I no longer snore and can even sleep on my back now, my blood pressure looks like I'm 20 years old again (I'm 47), I have zero arthritis pains, have had no allergy medications or even colds since I started, and my energy levels also seem to be like I'm in my 20's.  Some weird things I've also noticed were all my skin tags are gone around my neck, two cysts that were visibly protruding out of my body are gone (had them for years), and I've noticed my hair and nails are stronger.  Before this diet, my hair was rapidly turning gray, and I've had a few people accuse me of dying my gray out, when in fact my hair is growing dark and thick again.  Another one that I have no idea if it is connected or not, is that my vocal range when I'm singing has returned to what I thought I had lost over the years.  (probably inflammation related in the throat)   I would say I've been about 80% strict beef, butter, bacon, and eggs, but I also eat poultry, seafood, a lot of pork rinds, jerky, coffee, and sparkling flavored waters.",@VividAbominations,UCsQqAdWVZxiE4mT6qrmLA1g,0,2025-01-18T18:50:41Z,False,False,

I tried was convinced to start keto after watching a several Gary Taubes interviews and presentations. After a few weeks I had symptoms go away that I never even realized were so bad because I had been living with them for so long. I lost weight for the first time, I felt better mentally, my bloating and pain went away. My acne went away and I had clear skin for the first time since childhood. I had way more energy.  Then I had some high carb cheat meals when the holidays came around. I felt physically terrible eating them again and they didn't taste as good as I remembered.
That was the first time i had negative feedback from eating a cheat meal.
Another thing I realized was the foods I liked were high fat. Carbs were really just a delivery system for the foods i enjoyed.
I like butter, cheese, meat, eggs, steak, burgers, salmon, vegetables.
I didn't miss bread, rice, beans, tortillas, and chips.
I just found other delivery systems like cucumbers, lettuce, pork rinds.
I did come off keto for a while when my living situation changed and i was in a lot of social situations that pressured me into eating carbs and fast food. I felt terrible and I gained all the weight back. 
I now realize I have to treat carbs like a food allergy. My body does not tollerate them.",@kellyfitzpatrick3468,UCpiFaY_RnbSi0GPxv-ugScA,9,2025-01-18T17:16:14Z,False,False,

Two of my three siblings, my wife and a friend from work have all joined me in the ketosis realm, but they all sought it out.

I do eat a fair amount of eggs though which are relatively low cost and have decent calories.

I still don't understand why you think a diet low in carbs is also low in calories.  There are 3 kinds of macro nutrients, carbs, protein and fat.  Eliminating carbs leaves the other two, one of which has equal amounts of calories to carbs and one had 225% more calories than carbs per gram.  Maybe you mean that protein and fat are more satiating than carbs and it's harder to overeat calories?

Thats why its more difficult and maintain or go in caloric surplus on keto.

Extends life but affect hormones and more. 

""Consuming too few calories can affect hormones like testosterone, which is important for muscle growth, energy, and general well-being. This can lead to issues like fatigue, irritability, and reduced libido.""


I know what keto does for some people, and for me, I tried it. And it was great. Experienced less brain fog and eczema was no more. But my main concern is the low calories and that its difficult for me to get around 2000 calories by just eating bacon, eggs, meat, and fish. I am sure you can understand that?

After facing insomnia as a side effect of the newest drug I came to conclusion that these meds are actually doing what keto is doing naturally though without side effects. I'm gonna present this idea to my psychiatrist.

I stopped keto because I’ve been going through some difficult stuff. It’s a long story. However I want to get back to it. I don’t have much appetite for anything atm. :/ 
If I remained in ketosis, I never really craved anything. What really kicks in after a bit is the emotional connection to food. Like traditions or food from places I loved. It’s always a process. For those who think it’s sad to give up this or that food, on one level you’re right. However it really depends on how food impacts your health and whether or not a person chooses to treat their various conditions through diet. I can  limit my blood sugar and maintain a healthy weight on keto and if I’m doing it right, a bowl of candy or whatever doesn’t tempt me. If I’m doing it right, I’m not white knuckling it. The huge difference with keto, for me, was once I got into ketosis, it takes about 3 days, I’m no longer craving anything. I don’t enter the middle aisles of the grocery stores (where all the processed high fat/sugar stuff mostly is) anymore and if I do, I feel no cravings for that stuff.

Like with any dietary regimen it can vary greatly in its interpretation. It may surprise you to learn calf liver has more vitamin C than any fruit or vegetable.It's one of the most if not the most nutrient dense foods but many carnivores don't eat (like) liver and won't eat it.
Vitamin K2 is contained in almost all animal products like eggs, milk, cheeses, yogurt, meat, and fish in its most bioavailable form. The only reason I can think of when it might be wise to supplement is if one is supplementing vitamin D3 in ones' diet (carnivore other other) as it's important for optimal absorption of the vitamin D3. As for the rest I would refrain from making general statements as again, a lot depends on whether one eats nose to tail, and incorporates fish, shell fish etc and I would advise anyone considering to change to eating a carnivore diet to take the time and educate themselves as well as make changes gradually. 
How smoothly one can transition successfully depends a lot on what one was eating prior to starting. (there's usually a physical mental/medical indication) For example, there are many long term vegans  who ave destroyed their digestive tract to the point they have no other option than to proceed with a carnivore diet for healing. 
Years of consuming fruit and vegetable containing varying levels of oxalates will have left oxalate (crystals formed from the oxalic acid from seeds(&seed oil) nuts, dark leafy greens, turmeric, pulses, whole grains, sweet potato, etc, that absorbs calcium from the body ) throughout their entire body down to bone and blood levels and caused damage.... very sad because all the while they are convinced they are on the healthiest diet. It will take years for the body to excrete, eliminate the built up oxalate and can be a very painful experience, requiring a lot of patience...
 Ironically the body uses cholesterol to heal and repair the damage, one of its many essential functions.
Sorry, this is getting very long, not my intention so to learn more about oxalate and oxalate dumping I refer you to look up Dr. Sally K. Norton who physically underwent the process of eliminating oxalate from her body and has become world's leading expert. 
I hope this has inspired you to research more and help yourself and loved ones to dispel the false dietary advise we've been led to believe.  
 
P.S Please warn anyone you know who consumes green spinach rich smoothies regularly as 1 cup of spinach contains 3.5 times the ""safe"" amount of oxalate...    Oh and fibre is contraindicated as a dietary requirement and as an aid to constipation. In fact non soluble fibre is the very worst thing to consume if constipated. Many people argue that carnivore diet is bad because you may not have a bowel movement daily (say meat gets stuck lol) but that's because the nutrient dense food requires much less volume and is mostly absorbed.",@bow5326,UC4z_5B1y7fuK4RH_b0O6AvQ,2,2025-02-24T19:25:34Z,False,True,UgwBiyYQHd2kJzjkoy14AaABAg

Author worked in hospitals and recommended this diet to many of her patients, and even those with extremely bad health improved.
She was was inspired by mid XX c. naturopaths and didn't know back then what was causing the regeneration , but now in newer editions of her books she actually explains some of the mechanisms like fasting induced ketosis. Also this diet contains a lots of plants which  give the body extra dose of antioxidants and fibre which stimulate production of many regenerating factors like Sir2 proteins and telomerase and seem to activate ""deep-cleaning"" of the body. Many people on this diet can literally see their body flush out toxins in any shape and form- coughing, lipomas on skins, bad smell of breath/ urine/ sweat , diarrhoea, passing of kidney stones, inflammation etc -those unpleasant symptoms last only few days but after that whole body is rejuvenated. Some people report they scars, lumps, disappear, cartilage regenerates, autoimmune diseases, diabetes going into remission, coronary artery disease gone, glaucoma, gastrointestinal problems like constipation disappears, blood pressure becomes normal, women with fertility problems become pregnant, the list goes on and on.
 The protocol is to eat low calorie (800 kcal) , non starchy, no legumes, no nuts and seeds, not fatty fruits, no grains (so its gluten free), raw, fermented or cooked veggies and low sugar fruits for at least 2 weeks up to 4-6 weeks and its recommended to repeat repeating fasting from time to time (like once a year)- some people see vast improvement after 3rd ,4th time. There may be some unpleasant side effects at first as usually with ketosis, but generally people report feeling well and energized most of the time.",@lequoiscontreonu,UC9vafRKw7jUteAMoRNB3jbA,0,2025-01-17T23:11:00Z,False,False,

The impact on my health and well-being has been overwhelmingly positive. I’ve lost more than 28 kilos, which, naturally, required a complete wardrobe overhaul. Beyond the physical changes, this lifestyle has significantly improved my mental health, sharpened my focus, enhanced my clarity, and provided me with far more energy compared to when I followed a standard Western diet.

Living in Paris, France, I’m certainly not deprived of good food. However, I’ve completely eliminated carbohydrates like bread and pastries from my diet. Instead, I prepare my own keto-friendly breads and pastries. I strongly advocate for the combination of ketogenic eating and intermittent fasting, as it has worked wonders for me. My fasting window is typically 18 hours of fasting and 6 hours of eating (18:6), though I often stretch it to 20:4, and sometimes even 22:2.

Removing the carbohydrates (preferred fuel for the human metabolism) only suppresses/Band-Aids the underlying metabolic issues.

Dear Dr. Ede, the point is that fibre is needed for certain good gut bacteria, not directly for us humans. Clearly, people on Keto or Carnivore diet will change their gut microbiology composition.
Please have a talk with Prof. Tim Spector. I'm not sure, I'd you know enough about the gut microbiology and our need for fiber to propose it in your book, especially since this topic is also a rather new one and expanding

Still, it's interesting that people feel so well being on keto or carnivore diet (with no fibre) for a long time, like Inuit 🙏

I was already doing ""everything right""; clean eating, tons of exercise, etc., but it didn't work. Medications didn't work and only brought massive side effects.

Ketosis worked big time. It took around 2 weeks to see huge improvements, and in a month I was in remission. I've now been in ketosis for over 2 years. First year was keto, 2nd year was keto carnivore, and continuing on this road. As long as I'm in ketosis I don't have any symptoms. 

Ketosis saved my life. From nearly killing myself to thriving; I got into university last year, I'm in the best shape of my life without any effort (I do lift, but I eat as much as I want and don't gain weight), I'm never bloated, no brain fog, always calm and happy.

Everything Dr Ede says was/is true for me after following Keto/Carnivore for nearly 2 years to improve my chronic asthma and lung health. Results have been excellent and I've been able to avert having to go onto monthly Monoclonal Antibody injections. I still use preventer puffers x 2 but hope one day I can be free. 

I found definite improvements in ALL areas of my body. No joint pain, steady movement,  brain function/cognitive improvement. Skin, hair and nail health. Strength, peace and stability .. physical and mental. 

I wasn't overly focussed on weight but I did lose a few kgs along the way and my body changed shape and became firmer.
One interesting affect was that I didn't desire drinking  wine anymore 😮. 

I feel better now in my mid-70s than I've felt for years and haven't had an asthma event for nearly two years. Don't need to see the Respiratory Physician anymore. I fortunately have a wonderful doctor who has researched Ketogenic diet.

Re sticking to keto/carnivore eating long term,  I did sometimes crave certain foods I used to eat but that gradually disappeared over time and if I fell off track I just began again the next day.

I've lost weight, blurry vision, skin tags, brown underarm spots, stiff joints and muscles, the inability to move well after getting out of the car after riding for a while, cravings for sugar and carbs, total unexplained fatigue, no energy, and probably a thousand other things.  Gone.  I didn't know that seasonal affective disorder, feeling unable to do anything after 5 PM, and the other half dozen other things she mentioned came under the definition of mental illness; I've lost those too!  I'm 67, just adopted a HUGE Labradoodle, work a full-time job at the local community college, which I could never have imagined holding a 40-hour-a-week job before keto, and never felt better in my life.  I missed having a dog when my prior dog died in 2022; I just didn't get any exercise at all after he died.  Boy, am I getting exercise now.  

I remember working in 2019 with a colleague who brought in a huge sugary coffee product every morning to work.  She was a couple of years younger than me, and it was painful to watch her.  She was very heavy.  She forgot simple things.  She made a lot of significant mistakes in her work.  She was always complaining about not getting enough sleep, having to go to bed in the afternoon, or going in to work early in the morning and taking off early to go home and sleep.  Her life was really uncomfortable for her.  She retired a short while after I started work, and I never told her that her diet was wrecking her life.  She ate a LOT of carbs at the meals she brought in to work with her.  I brought in salads with olive and lemon and seeds, and sardines.

When I first went on the keto diet in 2017 it was exactly like an alcoholic going cold turkey, and at that time I didn't know about electrolytes.  I needed electrolytes.  It was a rough three weeks, and for me, maybe six weeks, but I kept going with it and I am SO glad I did.  It's like transitioning a house from burning coal to going solar.  You can't accomplish all of those changes overnight.

I did notice that I got COVID for the first time this past July, and during and after that time I was craving carbs like nobody's business -- plus, it was my birthday, and I deserved a piece of cake and some ice cream, right?  On my birthday?  Only my birthday treats became every-week indulgences.  In the new year now I've started a mostly carnivore diet and I can feel my body responding positively to this, plus all the extra exercise I'm getting, and I feel stronger than ever.  I think there is research saying that COVID messes with your carb cravings.  It's been really hard for me, post-COVID,  to get back off of carbs.

After listening to a Dr. Berg video from a couple of months ago, I started making my own l. reuteri yogurt.  I've got the recipe down now.  It's easy to do.  I buy the best milk and cream I can find.  I'm even giving a little dollop to my dog when I have mine.  That's our dessert.  My dog, by the way, is getting The Farmer's Dog.  I made my previous dog keto dog food every day, which I loved doing for him, and it took a TON of time and effort.  Now I have the choice of The Farmer's Dog, and I'm thrilled.

After one week of a strict therapeutic keto diet I felt like my brain had a 'factory reset' and I'm who I'm supposed to be.  It's like the clouds of depression and anxiety have cleared from me.  I honestly had zero idea I could feel this good, clear and positive and dare I say 'faster'.  I had no idea I was so depressed in relation to how I feel now.  It's like I can process ideas and problems at break neck speed and make a decision, not vacillate and wonder how to handle it or make a solid decision.  It was exhausting before.
I've been learning another language for years and I'm now blowing through lessons at a rate I can't believe with retention I didn't know was possible.  My workouts have been amazing and my muscle growth has been steadily going up.  
I've cut my insulin in half as well to about your amount.  A few months ago my endo told me I couldn't be his patient anymore because he was insisting I take statins even with my A1C at 5.4 with few hypos.  Endocrinologists discourage keto because they don't understand it and have a model for treatment that's at least 10 years old and are not trying in the least to modernize what new research has uncovered.

Getting rid of the fiber feels so much better! This was a total surprise for me because all my life, I had been trying to eat fiber to improve my digestion. (That is what I was told would help.) I also have better energy levels. I have not measured my keytones yet. I have been eating carnivore for 3 years, and my joints have improved remarkably. I was having difficulty navigating the stairs and losing muscle mass. In a week the stairs were easier.  In a month, without changing my exercise, I could feel my arms getting more muscular.  I am now dancing,  walking outdoors,  using a rebounder, sprinting, doing plyometrics, and resistance exercises with heavy weights. Also,  my measurement scores for bone density have moved from osteoporosis to osteopenia.",@florencesmith6866,UCue55R8bGflRbEqd64DNiEQ,23,2025-01-17T02:50:26Z,False,False,

However, I wanted to offer some constructive feedback as a fan of this podcast: I am not a fan of the Community Notes. Especially the note on “dietary fiber” which invalidated what Dr. Ede said. I come to this podcast to listen to cutting-edge research and discussions on new topics that are not mainstream and that challenge my current perspective. Adding the community notes like the one on dietary fiber take away from the magic of this podcast by adding disclaimers to what the guests are saying. Cutting-edge research is called cutting-edge because it exposes sharp truths that are hard to hear. The whole purpose of research is to challenge what we know to be true and to confirm new research with additional studies that show repeatability. However, the mainstream narrative is that we already know all there is to know so anything new or outside of the conventional narrative is harmful and wrong. Adding the community note on dietary fiber being necessary (which I have heard from many other keto doctors that it is not) caters to the conventional narrative and bends to the mainstream media like the BBC who criticize the truth-seeking nature of what makes this podcast so important. Further, it reminds me of Steven’s recent episode with Jordan Peterson in which Mr. Peterson says that as soon as Steven is concerned about his reputation, then the magic and quest-driven nature of this podcast will fall away. When I saw this community note, I saw someone trying to cover their ass, not someone trying to search for the truth regardless of all costs. I know it’s not easy, and I have the privilege of being invisible. I appreciate the efforts and sacrifices made in producing this podcast as this podcast has changed my life.

Depression is a bit different or difficult because it can be often misunderstood or misdiagnosed with chronic fatigue or chronic energy levels, or even narcissistic personality disorder. I love the doctor’s humility and flexibility on dieting. She is probably right that not everyone will benefit fully. She knows it works because of her own experience.

It’s the keto part that is not sustainable. You cannot live on 70% fat and higher and not expect your arteries to collapse. Dr. Atkins normal fat range was about 30% if you allow yourself to go on low-carb and then go off every 4 to 5 months onto a low fat diet and moderate carb. You’re basically only eating a little more fruit and vegetables. You’ll be fine one diet sits up the other no one stays on the keto diet forever. It’s not meant to be forever.

After another weekend were we had both felt very unwell & tired, we met an old friend who happens to be a successful dietitian, , we spoke of our switch to a keto diet, then she listed all the things we felt we were feeling in our bodies, she gave us a list of foods to try and see what difference it makes, to our surprise it was along the lines of what we used to eat , so we switched back to our old way of eating & it felt odd at first but with a few weeks it was like night & day, everything improved, we both agreed we hadn’t felt better in ages. While we loved the keto diet taking low carbs to no carbs is not advisable, certainly not for us, we now eat a healthy all round varied diet with regular fasting but not all the time, so beware of these fad diets just because it worked for this woman in her personal life , I don’t believe it suits everyone. If your like these people in the study she talks of who have serious brain disorders then maybe keto is for you, but for the average person I’d never recommend it.

Weight loss will also contribute to better mental health outcomes, whether from hormone control, social perception etc., which a lot of people will get when eliminating ultra processed foods, whether that be through keto, Mediterranean diet, plant-based et .

- ketogenic diet is any diet that lowers insulin levels to the fat burning point. This state is called ketosis. Your body chops fat into ketones which is alternative for glucose for the brain
- ketosis reduces inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. 
 - how easy and fast you get into ketosis depends on your ""metabolic damage"" People who more metabolically healthy, young ,athletic may just need to reduce some carbohydrates and get into ketosis. Older, less healthy need to be more strict. Some children get into ketosis after sleep on normal diet because they are metabolically healthy.
 -you can measure ketosis using ketone meter . W hen you reach levels above 0.5 mmol a lot of ""metabolic magic ""starts to happen because it activates certain pathways in the body and brain - those are recycling, maintenance  and recovery pathways. Thats why Dr Georgia Ede recommends  going into ketosis from time to time for everybody as a way to regenerate body
-ketosis stabilizes appetite hormones so you're not getting those spikes and crashes in glucose which cause spikes and crashes in appetite.
- ketogenic diet is high fat diet with ""moderate not excessive"" protein and little to no carbs
-ketogenic diet is not  the only way to achieve ketosis, ketosis also happens during fasting - eating nothing or during ""fast mimicking"" diet - restricting calories to 750 kcal a day. Ketogenic diet is also  ""fast mimicking"" but it provides normal amount of calories so it can be applied for long time
- you need at least two weeks to start to see the benefits
- ketosis improves metabolic health and mental health
- ketogenic diet is helpful in losing weight",@lequoiscontreonu,UC9vafRKw7jUteAMoRNB3jbA,1,2025-01-16T22:55:19Z,False,False,

The advice on the need to adjust to the Keto dietary lifestyle shows how addictive the general food environment is, an environment completely out of whack with how our bodies were adapted to live in, ie no freezers, no food around every rock and no 3 meals plus a day with nibbles on the go. The huge rise in mental health problems no doubt relates to our modern way of eating and the amount of sugar and additives, preservatives etc consumed.

I am not saying that it's 100% the cause, she eats refined carbs too. They just eat A LOT of meat and dairy. She is like 54... too young. I'd say there's a good chance saturated fat affects the brain. You can eat Keto without only eating meat 🤷‍♀ I think she said that, but worth reiterating.

It might be worth mentioning that I have lessened my meat and dairy and have been intermittent fasting for maybe 5 months and have consistently lost weight (20-30 lbs,) there may be a correlation to that and my lessened pain.

Nobel prize winner Dr. Linus Pauling and Dr. David Hawkins (author of Power vs Force), published Orthomolecular Psychiatry in the early 70's, which discussed the relationship between nutrition with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia. They're work was groundbreaking, but was heavily criticized and attacked by mainstream medicine and government health agencies. Nonetheless, their work sparked a new field of medicine, ""Orthomolecular Psychiatry,"" which later became broadly known as ""Orthomolecular Medicine."" In places like Canada, this field has simply become known as ""Holistic Nutrition"" as the government/College of Physicians wanted to ensure that there would never be any association between the terms/practices of ""medicine and nutrition."" It is quite the paradox that to this day natural practitioners/researchers are so heavily attacked, while MDs are praised for drawing the same conclusions (decades later) in a field they don't specialize in and have ostracized. I'm grateful that your platform is being used to raise awareness about natural approaches to mental health/disease. It would be amazing to see guests on your show who work specifically in the field of Natural/Holistic Medicine, who can share how far the research has really come. The information Dr. Ede shared is great, but at the same time I think it would be thrilling for your audience to hear the entire picture.

Medications don't work on me if taken orally. They work fine if taken bypassing the gut. I eat extremely low processed/packaged food. We eat homemade and fresh from the garden foods a lot.

They are designed with oversight of their doctors and nutritionalists. They have treat foods too in there, so it's all sorts of meals, mostly easy to make recipes. the key is not to choose all the treat ones lol, but lots of the hearty ones too. 

The benefits are I have no more eczema, no pimples. and lost my belly fat too and became nicely lean all over, I do weights for muscle building because I enjoy it, and am on par with my friends who still eat meat eggs dairy etc but I don't have that unwanted layer of fat most of them do. My endurance improved too.

Also for inspiration and just a good documentary watch 'Game Changers' by James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan that follows the rise of plant-based eating in professional sports. Thats now free to watch on Youtube.  

The PRCM recipes will help a lot. You'll notice theres foods you'd think you shouldn't eat, but can because they worked out the fibre content to slow the carb and sugars from absorbing too fast. Thats a key point why these recipes work without causing blood sugar spikes. Best of luck!",@brobinson8614,UCYu_biOaohz0O7x9yg6NMFw,0,2025-09-08T10:03:12Z,False,True,Ugy48zXZBexEj4czWNx4AaABAg

My reason for ketosis is just to be metabolically healthy and it delivers on that in spades.

Yes. *Everyone needs to be in ketosis at least once a month*",@homomorphic,UCiF1BYPtUaHy9KGuD-gpD2Q,1,2025-01-16T18:28:03Z,False,False,

I have also had back pain from a road accident when I was 16. Had followed the government and NHS guidelines on diet for many years, cut out animal fats, used vegetable and seed oils, margarine and limited eggs and dairy. Red meats were very rare in my diet. After my wife passed away 4 years ago I decided to change my diet completely. Eliminated veg and seed oils, started eating lots of eggs, cheese, butter and dairy. Red meat and fish often, particularly pork as it is a major source of essential nutrients. Cook mainly in animal fats. Cut down on carbs but still plenty of fruit and vegetables. Use olive oil and occasionally 'Cold Pressed' rapeseed oil. I cook from fresh or frozen with ready meals a rarity. Mainly a pizza once every couple of months as a treat. Within a year my arthritis had gone, I lost over 2 stone and I have just realised my back pain has gone. Not bad for an old codger aged 77. I can still chase the youngest grandchildren round and play garden badminton with them. My conclusion is 90% of good health is diet!!!! 
Always had backache from the age of 16 when I decided to argue with a van, the van won and I had a broken leg, a back injury and some short term memory brain damage. Over time the brain learns to ignore the pain although it is always present. Suddenly realised my back pain has gone. Says it all really.

It can be helpful to simply reduce carbs/sugars one step at a time. So for example, if you are drinking soda, drop that first and continue your diet as normal. Then once your body becomes accustomed to that, think of what you can eliminate next, like say, bread. Leave berries and other treats like honey as replacements for the high sugar foods you were consuming before. 

Eventually, you won't be reliant on those either. As your sense of taste becomes more refined, you might try some of those old foods again out of nostalgia. This is fine. You'll notice that soda will be absolutely disgusting now. If you didn't crave steak before, you'll find yourself savoring it in a way that you didn't think possible.

Many countries, including the one that I live in, forests have been cut for artificial grasslands or for the production of cattle food. Just look at the numbers of soy produced on former tropical forrest  (Brazil e.g.) grounds for cattle food. Most meat producers have to import this kind of destructive soy for their animals. The cows on 'original' gras lands are just very small numbers. 

Note: every kg of beef needs 7 kg of soy.

No way we can provide the world population with a meaty diet just on existing grasslands. The only way we can do it is with intense production methods, with nitrogen pollution (drinking water, biodiversity), deforestation, massive transports of cattle food and animals worldwide, CH4 emissions (specially from cows)  and for the lovers: also pesticides in the cattle food production.

Then lockdown came along and all of the weight went back on, so,,, I knew about the Atkins diet from twenty years ago but it was never really explained. As Georgia explained, if you have forced yourself tp produce insulin by eating carbohydrate ( cereals, pasta, bread potato etc) your body will not go into ketosis, its really that simple, your body converts fat into keytones,  your brain prefers to run on keytones, your immune system prefers keytones, your whole body prefers keytones, carbohydrates are natures emergency rations, ,,to be used in emergency only,,,. Everyone you know will be concerned for your health, I haven't felt this good since my thirties. A little tip to help you along, protein is very satiating, two rashers of bacon and an egg if you feel really hungry, if the hunger does not go away have more bacon and another egg, its almost total protein and fat and may trigger some insulin but not enough to knock you out of ketosis, use salads as a garnish with any meat, omelets, fish or chicken, but make sure you consume  all the fats on your plate as this is now your primary source of energy.

I don't say you have to do this, or that you shall do this, but we are all individuals and we are all different. 
Ketosis can be tricky, many people eat too much carbs, not enough protein, and struggle with healthy lipids. It's quite a game of finding what works for you, and you need to adjust.

I think each person different, I am 36yo woman, 47kg for 170cm, no health issues; exercising at least 3 to 5 hours a week, eating well and a lot, and can eat pretty much anything and eat a lot of carbs and whole foods only (no processed foods and sometimes some sweets like french crepes, ice cream but it's rare) and I never gain weight. 

I tried the keto diet just to see if it would change my life like so many other people said (I wanted more energy for the sake of it) and mainly to support my partner who was trying to lose weight and kept failing before trying keto. 

Being on keto was the worst thing I've never felt (dunno if Keto flu or carbs addiction detox or something else ??) but I felt terrible and hungry for something (carbs I guess) all the time! Had terrible night cramping while taking electrolytes supplements, I ate mostly grass fed beef and whole vegetables (like I used to before but removed the rice, bread that was with it and added more fat!). I also almost couldn't walk because I felt too TIRED in my legs all the time!!! 

When I eat carbs, I feel full and not hungry anymore, I never have craving or never snack, also on Keto, I gained a lot of FAT in my legs while I've always been lean! Which matched what Dr Stacy Sims said... 

Then I lost my periods on Keto (it never happened to me) and my cholesterol went up to the roof (I must be a LMHR so I didn't really worry about it) and my blood pressure kept dropping (I usually have very low BP because I used to avoid salt, but forcing myself to eat more guérande salt fixed that and thanks to the keto diet I realized my salt intake was super LOW); and had the WORSE PMS symptoms ever on keto (I never have PMS....)

So I decided to reintroduce carbs (after going Keto, carbs make me even more full than before now XD), my periods came back 2 weeks after carbs reintroduction, and I feel full of energy again, I do even more exercising now! I decided to fast and Keto (or low carb) right after my periods, then add up more carbs after ovulation to support progesterone. And also doing some seed cycling to see what it will do (still trying that rn so I don't have any benefits); I am combining what I've learned from Dr Stacy Sims and Dr Mindy Peltz and my own experience and feelings to see what works for me. (I still want to lower carbs intake for the sake of not developping insuline resistance).

My male partner on the contrary feels extraordinary on the keto diet! He lost about 7kg within 1 month and a half and feels full on the keto diet (while he was eating SO MUCH on high carb diet and always hungry - we had the exact same meals!); so we still eat the same thing but I would add a bit of bread or more fruit at the end of the meal and it works out! 

I was so frustrated to see that I did exactly the same diet as my partner but the results were so different, he felt amazing while I felt like I was dying... and IDK if it's because I wasn't fat adapted (while I'm used to do intermittent fasting for years; each time after my periods so I thought I'd adapt fast to keto) or if it's because of some genetic variation. Because when we used to eat more carbs with my partner, he'd gain so much weight and I wouldn't... We didn't even eat processed foods or a lot of sweets!! (appart from butter, yogurt : those kind of minimally processed foods)

So yea... I really don't know, I think that there's a lot of individual variations that must be taken into account, and also the male/female difference like Dr Stacy Sims said, women should work with their cycle, but I see so many woman on the carnivore diet and keto diet thriving!!! So it must really come down to individual variation I guess... in the end, try everything for at least a cycle or two and see how you feel!

Take your time. One meal a day until it feels normal. However long that may be, don't get discouraged. You didn't develop a bad diet overnight, you're not going to change it overnight. Just keep going. You're going to mess up. So what? Get back on it by the next meal. if you achieve 80/20 good meals over bad, you're still doing awesome.

I do have bad food every few weeks and relapse for a few days but I do get back on it. It's became a way of life now. I do think most times I fail is when I don't have food there ready to eat.

She could have gluten sensitivity leading to fibromyalgia, but she then blames all grains, for example. Had she ever tried sprouting her grains? Maybe she didn't get enough iron, zinc, calcium, etc... from the quantity of animal foods she was eating, then the antinutrients in her unsprouted grains/nuts/seeds wrought havoc. Maybe she even drank tea/coffee with meals, further creating an antinutrient paradise where every key micronutrient was being bound to by an antinutrient resulting in it all just passing straight through the body. She admits she was simply following what she had been told was ""healthy"" rather than following what her body was telling her as she ate her food.

I feel like a new person (except for the arthritis from the damage).  I have more energy than I have in over 30 years. I didn't stay on the full Keto diet after a while, because I found I needed a bit more good carbs to feel just right. I am more focused on the probiotic part of my diet now.

The standard American diet and Dieter is already working against their odds and health and time. 

Introducing more abnormalities and artificial crutches is making things more complex than they have to be and therefore more problematic generally. 

We live in relatively great times especially if you're in some of the better places in the states and elsewhere. 
But amongst us the horror. 

Eat the rainbow of foods mostly plants and stay away from processed stuff and adding chemical compounds into your body a top all the other poisons that you need to minimize being absorbed into your orifices skin and eyes.

In a generation or two we won't be Homo sapiens sapiens as we knew them and for many it's already passed. 

Of the existential things we might do something about and those that we can't one might not assume they'll be around tomorrow or by 2030 but they could be for 130 years +rather than the average 65 or half-life of a dog about 7-12 NOT 30 years...
The way animals and human livestock are treated should make one more rigid about carrying out good deeds for the right reasons, and not compromising so much just to enjoy oneself or to get by at a job or outlast an uncertain retirement that's shrinking geometrically.

Most animals that people cohabitate with with humans and would prefer not to be abused and eaten. 

What if people start using their drones to fish for cats and kids and dropping them off after hooking them? 

Sports...

Maybe it would be better if we cared for creation as if it's all we'll ever get and our health is all we'll ever have most  or not worth living without?!",@Madasin_Paine,UCph_F77VYFKXUn1QccSSw8w,0,2025-08-14T18:19:12Z,False,True,UgxoyxZUGKYv_dXLpdt4AaABAg

If you are young and in a good health, make a lot of sport, you can go to 50 g a day and stay in ketosis. It really depend on people and the type of keto diet you are making.
You also need to improve your fat intake, take care of the protein (it depend on a lot of factors, like for me at 59 yo I need more proteins than my daughter who is 40) and eat very carefully your vegetables (remind you, 100g lettuce is around 3 g of carbs). You need to avoid absolutely all the keto crap like breads or pastries even if they are very low carbs. 
If you stay in this type of clean keto diet, it will be very easy to stop any craving, to go effortless to one meal a day, and to have all the benefits of this diet, beyond your expectations.
(in my case, after 13 months in it: 25kg less, no more pain in any joints (was a lot before), no craving (ex bulimia), the sleep is way better, straight 7 hours without going to pee one or two times a night like before, mood balanced, all day long the same power, no naps after food, urine leaks finished, and a lot of little other benefits.

And you should know that even if you are starving some people, when they are insulin resistants they can't no longer loosing weight, but the same person with way more calories but calories from fat will loose weight. It's exactly my case since I went through menopause.
Second, think about this: if a sedentery person eats every day 3000 calories of lean meat and greens for a month, and the same person eats every day 3000 calories of Rees's bar (249 calories a bar, 12 bars a day) for a month, do you think he will gain weight in the first case? But you are certain he will takes weight in the second case. Even if you think he will gain weight in the first case (I'm sure not but ok), you can understand that he can't gain the same as in the second case with Rees's bars.
Isn't it? If it's not clear for you, do the experiment on yourself, it could blow your mind.
Third, if you inquire about the fat as a fuel of the body and the cells, how insuline works and so on, you'll understand that calories is close to totally irrelevant.
Fourthly, do you know how the calories are calculated? Google it if not. How combustion with fire can be the equivalent of the body's ""combustion"" of food? More and more of scientists, even out of the ketogenic sphere, are aware of the irrelevance of the calories and I don't give a lot of years before it will be debunked or at least seen as a clue but not a law.",@victoriagossani8523,UCJMkDHyer09Vqt2YGq9Za7w,0,2025-01-31T17:23:19Z,False,True,UgzJo_sAIddAAcX09p94AaABAg

All my life as I’ve been a transformative individual Trying to have these conversations with people since I was a little kid watching my poor parents who are so amazing get made sick in the system with every kind of melody, and then die an early death from an illness that was completely created by the system so that then they become healthcare consumers and then they can extract more out of you until they’re extracting everything out of you, including paying for your coffin and funeral. Another interesting Enterprise when we should be putting humans back into the Earth for the cycle to continue instead of putting these other things into the earth where we eat food out of the whole thing is a absolute shit show and when you’ve seen most of your families suffering with mental illness Like mine and you are the healthy, happy healthy, one trying to be a role model saying hey this can be done better and you have people so program that they literally are angry at you if you suggest that this can be transformed if they come into greater consciousness grow and awaken into the truth of reality and gain some skills to recover themselves heal from systemic trauma Overcome dysfunctional dynamics caused by the trauma being proliferated by the system of toxicity and that we might be able to ban together as a family and do it better. If we were all on the same page it’s fascinating to see people with their family or friends get legitimately enraged when you suggest what’s happening to them and what they can do to change it. It’s also fascinating that when you don’t want to Destroy yourself with alcohol, drugs, bad food, gossip, drama, and general over consumption and self-destructive behaviors how you’re considered to be someone who is not fun or trying to be above people or who does she think she is in all of this stuff which can happen from friends family even when you dare to put out Content on social media and let people know that there is help. The crazy part about how bad the system destroys people on purpose keep keeping them just weak enough that they’ll be controlled and just strong enough that they can push themselves and work to death in some crazy slave 80 hour week process where they keep getting more and more productivity out of people while charging more for everything and lowering wages It’s fascinating to see that even when you help people awaken how angry they are at you and make awful terrible comments because they’re so jacked up. They can’t even believe that someone in the world let alone all of the amazing influencers who could be doing anything with their time because they have plenty of money and they put themselves out in order to help people and then you have people making these awful comments which I see happening all the time And it is because people have been so traumatized by the system by the very people that they’re supposed to be able to trust have their best interest at heart while they’re being betrayed on every level in the worst manipulation possible no wonder people cannot believe that leaders who care us to share with them things that will benefit them actually care about them in a real way because they’ve never really had that from the beginning. Their parents were dysfunctional because the system is this way. Their family is dysfunctional because the system is this way the schools dysfunctional because the system is this way. Everything is dysfunctional on purpose in order to distract people from people transferring the wealth through manipulative things that are happening in the government, transferring it to certain people transferring it to the wealthy people with the companies who poison people with various kinds of products and it’s so sad every time I see people saying something negative comment about some person who takes enough care about society and humanity to put some content out and you can see how sick people are and the sickest ones are the ones who respond with something negative When someone is literally giving them a lifeline to escape from the people who are literally killing them each and every day steadily and intentionally and it’s just a fascinating reality that I am excited for it to shift in the ways that are happening now. Not only is this making people crazy negative awful criminal, but it goes into every aspect of society where you have parents so anesthetize they can’t pay attention to their own child’s mental health issues and some poor sick kids who have been poisoned more than any other cohort that has ever happened Because now Marketing is even more prolific and these people end up committing these heinous acts, shooting children doing all these awful things because they are literally being made crazy by the day in every way, and I am really excited for people to wake up and see that it literally comes from the baseline foundational power structure infrastructure of profit over people. Of course food is our medicine. Do you think that we would be designed to require all of this extra stuff when we were designed to thrive and be happy and healthy and alive. We’re supposed to be alive and creating new worlds and being in what’s supposed to be heaven on earth and here we are with a minority, but a very powerful minority who is literally maybe 10% of the world and it controls 90% of the people just by doing this to them. It is the ultimate power And leverage and the good news is that 90% of the people are a lot more than 10% so the numbers are with the masses whenever they decide they’re sick and tired and they’re not gonna take it anymore. They want you to believe that they’re more powerful, but the numbers are with the masses and even if we say it’s 20% of the people are in the power structure and 80% of the people are in the masses The masses have the numbers and it just takes a collective banning together in a revolutionary attitude seeing the truth, pulling it out, not letting them intimidate us, which is their whole game plan recognizing that they’ve been the predator and we’ve been the prey and literally flipping the tables real housewives Style And recognizing that we are now rising up into our power into the truth, and we are totally capable of recovering and rehabbing ourselves into the strongest version of ourselves that will not be dominated and will not tolerate this anymore. And when we no longer buy their products that they’re products that they’re using to get us to kill ourselves while we pay for the privilege to do it they will not have any profits, and they will crumble, and the true humanitarian leaders of the world will finally come into power and that is what we are saying on YouTube with the world‘s most well intention leaders pouring themselves into a transformation for humanity. It’s time for a revolution in our reality and it’s great to see that most everyone on here in this community is completely tuned in and tapped in and this is why our great leader Steven is here to lead a revolution bigger than anything he could ever imagine and we’re all here side-by-side in unity together for a greater higher reality for humanity And this is our joint endeavor. The good news is that when people live in a purpose that is so much greater than themselves they’ll always be plenty of money and resources to take care of ourselves and we don’t have to make profits over people are DNA anymore having that programmed into us is why we will systematically participate in destroying ourselves doing levels of work that are so injurious to humans All to make so much money that not even one human could spend in a lifetime and I’m excited to see these kings and queens of reality go entirely all in for a humanitarian purpose, and know that they will be rich beyond their measure without even having to try to make money. Truth is the highest frequency and it’s the greatest wealth there is it makes us strong and powerful and plenty of resources of every kind, and all the energy flow to the top of the frequency were truth as they always say will set us free.",@drtracythomas,UCQCkrWIKRJi-IEMvZ8-GB6A,0,2025-01-16T12:10:30Z,False,False,

For example, there are certain SNP, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e. norm variants that occur quite frequently, such as slow COMT. These people can break down chatecholamines poorly. This includes, among other things, stress hormones, oestrogens, histamine, thyramine and other biogenic amines (these are found in foods, even or mostly in healthy ones). If this COMT enzyme is too little active, this leads to the accumulation of stress hormones, oestrogens and above all neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, histamine and other activating neurotransmitters and this in turn leads to sometimes severe psychological symptoms, like severe insomnia and anxiety. Especially with a ketogenic diet this can be aggravated because this diet increases the endogenous chatecholamines.",@Anita-wh4vr,UCnVkf_TbDJm2gW2uiCAinvg,6,2025-01-16T10:59:26Z,False,False,

But what we are talking about here - the ketogenic diet - is a specific metabolic state where your body and brain utilises fat for energy. This has unique benefits and differences from using glucose as energy. Some people find it makes them more energetic and improves their mood. If you want to argue against the ketogenic diet then it should be based on which metabolism you believe to be better or worse than the other. That’s really the crux of this discussion. (Also check out interviews with Chris Palmer who goes more in-depth about the metabolic theory of mental health). They’re starting to study this theory but it’s still early days.

I have been type 1 for nearly 55 years and I seem to be completely normal in every way - no complications. I used to eat loads of sweet stuff as well as natural fats so would have put weight on but no longer eat sweet stuff or carb staples. Cut out all seed/veg oils and check everything for those. I can't do much exercise at moment as have cellulitis (again) and get back ache. Have terribly sedentary job but try and at least move around a bit. I think answer is cut down on protein and fat as too many calories will still put weight on and too much protein gives high blood glucose so I'll just have to eat oily fish and eggs with salad and veg that are neither high in oxylates or potassium.

Herbivore teeth have flat molars for chewing plants while omnivore teeth are serrated for stabbing flesh.  Herbivores’ jaws can move from side to side, while omnivore jaws cannot. Compared to herbivores, omnivores produce much more stomach acid for digesting meat, fish and chicken. The intestines of humans are nine times their body length while the intestines of true omnivores are three times their body length which helps to facilitates the rapid movement of meat, chicken and fish through the gut preventing the putrification that results in humans as a result of slow elimination. Humans are anatomically herbivores and do not have the mixed physiology seen in pure omnivores.The assumption that humans are designed for eating meat is wrong as their teeth have become very small and rounded, function only as accessories to the incisors and are useless for ripping apart or tearing anything stronger than an envelope.",@e.cornell3345,UCo7UrVCoMgpk5jNQffUHCYA,0,2025-01-19T12:38:08Z,False,True,UgwGttYG_6YadWugMzd4AaABAg

In terms of air miles, there's evidence that importation of fruit and veg from countries in the southern hemisphere to countries in the northern hemisphere actually produces less emissions than producing them in countries that do not have the climate for them and therefore require significant amounts of artificial heat and light. 
Additionally, there's the fact that 75% of soy from the Amazon is directed towards farms in foreign countries to be used as animal feed, which is then added on to the carbon footprint of consumers of meat.

Carbs and sugar, processed foods have you go UP and DOWN all…day…long.  It’s no secret that sticking to high protein low carbs helps with mood. 

I also recommend incorporating a weight training regimen and try to get lots of sleep.

As a man, my experience I got headaches from low carb and it was due to lack of salt. They went away when I started salting the food thanks to Stan Efferdings recommendation.

I say this because I haven’t just noticed this with nutrition and my illness but also other areas too. 

For example I was having a terrible side effect to an antipsychotic they put me on. It was really bad and thankfully my mom started to advocate for me because I was in a manic episode

She kept insisting the over the top side effect was due to one of my meds 

She first thought this because the symptoms of the side effect increased when they upped that med 

But my psychiatrist and another medical professional on my care team kept telling her the symptom couldn’t be from that med and instead kept saying it’s just one of my mania symptoms 

My mom ended ip researching so much and it was so hard to find but eventually she found law suits by people against the company for the same symptom 

After she presented that info they finally agreed to take me off and boom my crazy embarrassing side effect was gone 

Made me wonder how many other people are out there doing crazy things and being told it’s due to their illness rather than the med. 

Actually so many of my BPD symptoms are also symptoms some experience from the meds I’m on

I know I definitely have bipolar but I’m just saying sometimes we have to dig deep for appropriate care.

I have other examples like this too. 

Will be documenting my keto journey on my channel in case you’re interested in following along. Thanks again",@TheBipolarBoss,UCCY-1n70e24Sq2YaNPyP24A,0,2025-01-17T07:10:48Z,False,True,UgwMJZJs2UnjR6cFBi14AaABAg

Thanks for sharing that . I personally get more tired with excess protein . Protein and fats are the hardest to digest food which is why they are satiated but I never understood why people say to eat it for energy . 
Traditionally , carbs (natural ones ) are your instant energy source and protein rebuilds tissues that are damaged . 
I do have a contention about keto and meat . You can be in ketosis and never eat meat at all . Again , the keto diet is about switching energy source from glucose to fats . You can do that successfully with coconuts , olives , avocados , nuts , flax and chia seeds , etc… keto does not necessarily mean meat but carnivore does .",@Iconic3509,UC67hY0LOPPUmNzXIBrH3uWA,1,2025-01-18T11:40:49Z,False,True,UgwMJZJs2UnjR6cFBi14AaABAg

You're going to need a few things in my  opinion. I'm not a doctor.

You'll need: a list of brainstorm meal ideas,  a list of allowed and disallowed ingredients and extra disallowed (ex. Glutenand sugar at no costs!), brainstorm & research condiment options and other new product solutions like almond crackers or jicima wraps or monk fruit etc because the time when the cravings hit will not be a good time to buy those.. its too late,  a plan for what you'll do to need cravings met or what to eat when you want to eat something special or different (ex. Guacamole and low carb chips, or keto muffins, keto chocolate fudge, bacon butter bites etc, learn how to make broth GAPS meat stock soup broth if possible,  and lastly, you're going to need epsom salt baths and activated charcoal for detoxing. Activated charcoal is a binder, it can only be taken 2 hours away from anything important.  So if Important meds are at 1 and 5 then charcoal can only be at 3pm.  Learn about detoxing to help you feel better. Headache, tiredness,  achiness, worsened mood instability, eyes hurting etc- could all be the need to detox. Keto diet almost always needs to involve detoxing.  Also you might like the book gut and psychology syndrome  by neurologist nutritionist Dr Natasha Campbell Mcbride. 

I'm cheering you on!! 🎉  my best friend from high school as well as my cousin both have a bipolar-schizophrenia situation.   I think they'd both improve drastically on a Gluten free keto diet.

I have to diet and exercise religiously, and if I do that, I feel pretty stable. No medication necessary. I don't feel so all over the place and mood swingy. I don't feel anxious and depressed and irritable. And so help me God, if I get off work and eat Taco Bell once, I will start feeling like crap all over again the next day. If you eat once a day, that will help a ton even if you don't watch what you eat. Doing keto is probably better if you can't make it through the day without eating. I was on a mood stabilizer called lamotragine for a while. It made my head hurt and feel really irritable at first, but it did help me a lot. It made me feel like doing stuff and lose weight. I started thinking happy thoughts again, but it made me think a little slower and I didn't like that. A lot of people don't talk about the potentially permanent side effects of psychiatric medication. I swear my sleep is still messed up from antidepressants. And I still don't think my brain functions the same from the mood stabilizer. I can't say if that's a good or a bad thing.

If that's not enough, high-heat cooking of meat  (grilling, frying, broiling) produces HCAs, PAHs, and AGEs—compounds linked to cancer, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Meat can also contain dioxins, toxic pollutants in animal fat that disrupt hormones and raise cancer risk.

Carbs from vegetables are better than carbs from sugar. Fat from animal sources are healthier than seed oils. My sleep apnea went away. My lactose intolerance is gone. The difference in my general health is huge. I developed healthy habits to where I don't have to track calories and macros anymore.

Week 1 remove all refined sugar, week 2 remove all grains (wheat, corn, rice, oats etc), week 3 remove white potatoes and seed oils, week 4 remove all fruit and other starchy veg. A gradual approach will help prevent adaptation symptoms, aka 'keto flu' which is actually just carbohydrate withdrawal, and will also mean you start switching over to a fat burning state in an easier fashion. Oh, and while you're transitioning, start each day with just fat and protein (eg bacon and eggs cooked in butter) as you'll be going into ketosis overnight (if you have a long enough gap between dinner and your first meal), and starting the day like this will ensure you continue in that state for longer.
