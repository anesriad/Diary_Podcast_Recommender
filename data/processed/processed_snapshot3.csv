Yes, therapy can shift your mental/physical state, and it‚Äôs lovely that he helps people, but that doesn‚Äôt answer any existential questions about why people cannot find purpose, and is that universal.

I think that Stephen presented some great examples with friends who were both feeling down. None of the guests truly answered these questions and yet they each thought that they did. 

The Christian said that meaning will be found in religion and belief in higher power. 
The psychiatrist said that meaning is found in both a higher power and after a person does therapeutic work that affects their brain. 
The atheist says that meaning was evolutionarily diminished, and this is why we are feel aimless and lost, and anything else is subjective thought, and not necessarily truth. 

I think it was absolutely brilliant to bring all three of these different viewpoints together. Even if most of it was not fascinating, all are worth hearing. Of course we can feel better with belief in a higher power, like the friend in Dubai, because then we are connected to something greater than ourselves. (Though it was still shocking to hear a person state that the subjective feeling was ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of truth. Erm, no.) Of course we can find meaning and purpose by changing our neurobiological chemistry through therapeutic action, but we also need to understand our own existence when we are intellectual. Of course we will have more time to ponder why we are here and what we should be doing when we are no longer being chased by Sabre tooth cats. I believe that this evolutionary understanding is what benefits me the most.

Humans are complex, social beings with the leisure to think about their own existence.

For context i am a 19 yo german, who grew up christian and generally believes in a higher being, that most people would call god.  Since god gave us free will, the first order purpose that we are given is to live life. Since this is a very broad purpose there are subdivisions to this purpose. I think people generally search for the subdivisions and hope that they are given this ‚Äûsecond order‚Äú with their birth. But i think that your own second order purpose cant be given  by outside powers (even god), you have to go out there and create it yourself and it will be your contribution to gods creation. However, that doesnt mean that what you are doing is gods plan, generally speaking i am very very very carefull with people that claim that god is working through them or with them or whatever (you should be too). ‚ÄûThe road to hell is plastered with good intentions.‚Äú I would add to this ‚Äû and bad intentions disguised as such‚Äú.  With this free will that you are getting, you also get the choice to walk a path without god, that doesnt mean it is a bad path by the way, since you can contribute without gods help. I know that the last sentence kind of stands at odds with what i said previously, but i have to specify: one of the ground pillars of chrisitanity is to help others help themselves. I think it is not valued enough as a pillar looking through the political world and its quick fixes( a discussion one might lead another time(: .) And i think god only provides such help, help to help yourself so that you can help others help themselves, it is most definitly a if not the way to grow and be prosperous‚Ä¶(also in an economic sense). Alright now that we have gone through that, christianity is most certainly not the only way to this higher being. Other religions and other pratices are also very valid and real( Many roads lead to Rome.)  Next up i will open a barrel that i maybe shoudnt open and that is fairly controversial however the ground texts ( Bible, Tora, Quran, Veden and so on and so forth, if i didnt mention the ground texts of your religion please forgive me it doesnt mean that i dont recognise  them but i am just a lad writing this stuff straight out of my head.) of all religions were not written through this/these higher beings  and also not with them.( I am no expert in any of these texts, but i am most familiar with the bible.) That doesnt mean they dont have value to humanity it just means you have to take everything with atleast a grain of salt. With every statement that is stated your thought process should be, could there be general value in this statement in todays society or does it feel wonky or at odds with your consciousness. When was it written and what were the historical circumstances and why could it have  been written for political gain or general advantage taking of the population. Generally speaking rules like the 10 commandmends or the commandmend of love in the new testament are rules for coping with our human nature and living with a broader bigger society than the small groups of 150 we were living in at the begining( check out the theory of Robin Dunbar). Some ideas on how to cope with your problems emotionally, that are given in these texts are proven in psychological studies. Now you might ask what is the purpose of religions around the world. Valid question and i will try to answer it best i can: Religions are there to create a broader togetherness in society, to link people that have nothing in common together ( check out the psychology behind this), to create discussions about topics that trouble humanity, to find solutions to these, to settle conflict in a permanent matter without wiping one or both sides out, to anker you through traditions and connections and live your life the way you see fit without restricting your freedom by restricting the freedom of others, to give you guardrailes, the opportunity to forgive others and espescially yourself. Religions are to be questioned since they are lead by people and most importantly by humans, humans are with fault. Dont try to give the responsibility of your life to someone else, take the responsibility yourself and dont throw everything infront of god or some human, help yourself‚Ä¶ God is not in everything, tradgedies happen and sometimes they are no ones fault, forgive and lead a better life without the grudges that eat away at you.Although this comment isnt covering all i wanted to say, i hope i was of help to you this or atleast gave you food for thought, if you have a different opinion on something i am glad to hear it, just be polite and stay human.

this  and bad intentions disguised as such.  with this free will that you are getting, you also get the choice to walk a path without god, that doesnt mean it is a bad path by the way, since you can contribute without gods help. i know that the last sentence kind of stands at odds with what i said previously, but i have to specify: one of the ground pillars of chrisitanity is to help others help themselves. i think it is not valued enough as a pillar looking through the political world and its quick fixes( a discussion one might lead another time(: .) and i think god only provides such help, help to help yourself so that you can help others help themselves, it is most definitly a if not the way to grow and be prosperous(also in an economic sense). alright now that we have gone through that, christianity is most certainly not the only way to this higher being. other religions and other pratices are also very valid and real( many roads lead to rome.)  next up i will open a barrel that i maybe shoudnt open and that is fairly controversial however the ground texts ( bible, tora, quran, veden and so on and so forth, if i didnt mention the ground texts of your religion please forgive me it doesnt mean that i dont recognise  them but i am just a lad writing this stuff straight out of my head.) of all religions were not written through this/these higher beings  and also not with them.( i am no expert in any of these texts, but i am most familiar with the bible.) that doesnt mean they dont have value to humanity it just means you have to take everything with atleast a grain of salt. with every statement that is stated your thought process should be, could there be general value in this statement in todays society or does it feel wonky or at odds with your consciousness. when was it written and what were the historical circumstances and why could it have  been written for political gain or general advantage taking of the population. generally speaking rules like the 10 commandmends or the commandmend of love in the new testament are rules for coping with our human nature and living with a broader bigger society than the small groups of 150 we were living in at the begining( check out the theory of robin dunbar). some ideas on how to cope with your problems emotionally, that are given in these texts are proven in psychological studies. now you might ask what is the purpose of religions around the world. valid question and i will try to answer it best i can: religions are there to create a broader togetherness in society, to link people that have nothing in common together ( check out the psychology behind this), to create discussions about topics that trouble humanity, to find solutions to these, to settle conflict in a permanent matter without wiping one or both sides out, to anker you through traditions and connections and live your life the way you see fit without restricting your freedom by restricting the freedom of others, to give you guardrailes, the opportunity to forgive others and espescially yourself. religions are to be questioned since they are lead by people and most importantly by humans, humans are with fault. dont try to give the responsibility of your life to someone else, take the responsibility yourself and dont throw everything infront of god or some human, help yourself god is not in everything, tradgedies happen and sometimes they are no ones fault, forgive and lead a better life without the grudges that eat away at you.although this comment isnt covering all i wanted to say, i hope i was of help to you this or atleast gave you food for thought, if you have a different opinion on something i am glad to hear it, just be polite and stay human. i wish you the best. greetings from bavaria.","{'score': 0.2, 'category': 'Positive', 'score_raw': 0.5, 'category_raw': 'Neutral'}",0.2,Positive,0.5,Neutral,1.0,0.2

linguistics experts have stated that hebrew is an african-asiatic language.","{'score': -0.09999999999999998, 'category': 'Neutral', 'score_raw': 0.2, 'category_raw': 'Neutral'}",-0.09999999999999998,Neutral,0.2,Neutral,1.0,-0.09999999999999998

It's a formula that's been passed down through generations‚Äîstructured, linear, and, for a time, widely attainable.

But in today‚Äôs world, that blueprint feels increasingly out of reach for many. Economic instability, skyrocketing living costs, shifting job markets, and the pressures of modern life have made what was once considered a standard path far less accessible. Even more, many are beginning to question whether that path was ever truly fulfilling in the first place‚Äîor if it was simply a social expectation dressed up as purpose.

The truth is, not everyone fits into that mold. Some realise early on that their aspirations lie elsewhere. For others, the realisation comes later, often after chasing the traditional path and finding it empty or unattainable. As the old narrative begins to unravel, a deeper question emerges: If not that, then what?

In the absence of a clear, universal road map, people begin to search for meaning and purpose elsewhere. For some, it‚Äôs in spirituality or religion‚Äîfinding solace and direction in faith. For others, it‚Äôs through physical pursuits like fitness or athleticism, where the body becomes a vessel for discipline and transformation. Some turn to creativity‚Äîart, music, writing‚Äîas a way to express their inner worlds. Others dive into nature, activism, community, entrepreneurship, or personal growth.

The point is, the search for meaning doesn‚Äôt follow a single path. It‚Äôs personal. And in a world where the traditional markers of success are no longer guaranteed‚Äîor even desirable for some‚Äîthis search becomes more important than ever.

What we‚Äôre seeing is not a loss of direction, but a shift. A shift from living by default to living with intention. From chasing what we‚Äôre told we should want, to discovering what truly matters to us.

Meaning isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôre handed‚Äîit‚Äôs something you create. And purpose isn‚Äôt always found in achieving a big, bold goal; sometimes it‚Äôs in the quiet commitment to living authentically, staying curious, helping others, or simply being present.

In my opinion, God is a coping mechanism that is too obvious to fall back on to search for a purpose that is not a true meaning and is told to you to believe not to find it yourself. I think i'm leaning more towards the atheist route, however for death to be such a massive part of life there has to be something after death.

Perfectly said. I think that Alex is just too used to being in ""debate mode"" that he just has it on in every discussion, even though its not needed at times. What he's maybe missing is that humans, or at least most humans, are not rational creatures. Our feelings often override our logic. 

And so, is it really necessary to definitively assert that we only need logical answers and solutions? I mean, ideally, yes maybe thats good. But it can only work if it we live in an idealistic utopia where the best answers can be universally taught to and understood by everyone, and everyone has the same intellectual capacity and environment to be able to accept it.

I find that in the end, best solutions always comes in spectrums and variations. Alex is on the left while Greg's on the right. And Dr K is the one who's aware of this spectrum and is more practical with his approach. Different people have different methods of living with the world.


But then, I see Alex's point. I dont think we'll evolve much as a species until we grow out of these ""coping mechanisms"". Because we saw what happens when world powers were motivated by these claims of objective truths (which is greg's side).
