What the ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù psychiatrist describes, (over and over yikes) as ‚Äúquantifiable,‚Äù that specific action having a neurobiological effect leading to feeling less depressed and finding meaning‚Ä¶is essentially therapy. Yes, therapy can shift your mental/physical state, and it‚Äôs lovely that he helps people, but that doesn‚Äôt answer any existential questions about why people cannot find purpose, and is that universal.

I think that Stephen presented some great examples with friends who were both feeling down. None of the guests truly answered these questions and yet they each thought that they did. 

The Christian said that meaning will be found in religion and belief in higher power. 
The psychiatrist said that meaning is found in both a higher power and after a person does therapeutic work that affects their brain. 
The atheist says that meaning was evolutionarily diminished, and this is why we are feel aimless and lost, and anything else is subjective thought, and not necessarily truth. 

I think it was absolutely brilliant to bring all three of these different viewpoints together. Even if most of it was not fascinating, all are worth hearing. Of course we can feel better with belief in a higher power, like the friend in Dubai, because then we are connected to something greater than ourselves. (Though it was still shocking to hear a person state that the subjective feeling was ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of truth. Erm, no.) Of course we can find meaning and purpose by changing our neurobiological chemistry through therapeutic action, but we also need to understand our own existence when we are intellectual. Of course we will have more time to ponder why we are here and what we should be doing when we are no longer being chased by Sabre tooth cats. I believe that this evolutionary understanding is what benefits me the most.

Humans are complex, social beings with the leisure to think about their own existence. I think about my childhood and how everything was about joy in the moment, playing was paramount, and how life through my limited ancillary lens resulted in a less complicated world.

Now we are all more and more separated via technology. We spend too much time alone, in our own technology bubble.
